    "facts_of_case": "of the present case. 76. The impugned order of cancellation is being challenged as an illegal, arbitrary and disproportionate executive fiat. The petitioner is not seeking to establish any new right but attempting to safeguard its rights under the allotment made in its favour. The impugned order itself recites that it was passed not only to protect the interest of YEA but also the sub-lessees and homebuyers. It thus seeks to subserve larger public interest. As such, it cannot be said that the writ petition is liable to be thrown out on the ground of maintainability. However, the exercise of power of judicial review shall have to be within the well established parameters. 77. Issue No. 1 is, thus, answered against YEA and in favour of the petitioner holding the writ petition as maintainable. ISSUE NO. 2 and 3: Whether the terms of the allotment letter, except those, specifically referred to and incorporated by reference in the lease dead, survive after the execution of the lease deed vis-a-vis the land parcels which are leased under the lease deeds? And Whether the impugned cancellation of the allotment letter by letter dated 12.02.2020 has the consequent effect of cancelling the lease deed, in the absence of specific cancellation of the lease deed? Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148801015/ 34 M/S Jai Prakash Associates Ltd vs State Of U.P. And Another on 10 March, 2025 78. As these issues are inter-connected, they are being addressed simultaneously. (A) Salient Features of Allotment, Lease and SDZ Policy: 79.

The petitioner applied in response to notice inviting application by the lessor for development of SDZ in the development area of YEA with SPORTS as core activity. It discloses the nature of right created i.e., lease, with a specific reference to the allotment letter in pursuance of which the lease was executed. The period of lease, the area of land demised, the description of land in Schedule-II attached to the lease and also the premium i.e., consideration were clearly stated. Paragraph 3 of Preamble stating that the parties had agreed to the demise on 'terms and conditions contained in these presents' is crucial. It reveals that rights and obligations of the parties in respect of lease hold right would be governed by the terms and conditions set out therein. One of the lease deeds, executed on 25.09.2009, in pursuance of allotment letter dated 20.03.2009 is reproduced below: \"LEASE DEED This Deed of Lease is made on this 25th day of Sept 2009 Between Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEA) (Name changed from Taj Expressway Industrial Dev...",

M/S Jai Prakash Associates Limited (in short 'JAL' or 'the petitioner'), is a Company incorporated\nunder the provisions of Companies Act, 1956. Initially, the writ petition was filed against two\nrespondents, i.e. the State of U.P. and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (in\nshort 'YEA' or 'Authority'), later on, around 258 home-buyers were impleaded pursuant to order\ndated 19.09.2023 passed by this Court. The petitioner-company was facing winding up proceedings\nin the form of CP (IB) No.330/ALD/2018 (ICICI Bank Vs. Jai Prakash Associates Limited) and one\nMr. Bhuvan Madan was appointed as Interim Resolution Professional (in short 'IRP'). For this\nsubsequent development, the petitioner was permitted to be represented through the said IRP and,\nconsequently, the cause title was amended pursuant to the order dated 26.07.2024.\n\n4. The prayer made in the writ petition is to quash the order dated 12.02.2020 passed by respondent\nno.2 (YEA) whereby the allotment of land made by the said respondent in favour of the petitioner\nhas been cancelled. Further, a mandamus has been sought restraining the respondents from\ninterfering with the peaceful possession of the petitioner over the land in question and from taking\nany other coercive action pursuant to the order impugned; further direction to respondent no.2 to\nprovide requisite amenities such as water, sewer and drainage and to take all other requisite steps\nfor effective implementation of the Escrow Agreement dated 24.09.2018. The writ petition was\namended and further prayers were added to quash the resolution dated 28.6.2021 (Annexure\nNo.37-B) passed by the Board of YEA in its 70th Board Meeting in so far as YEA sought to levy\nrestoration charges upon the petitioner and limited the proposed re-schedulement and\nre-computation of the dues to the year 2023. Another relief claimed is for quashing the\nconsequential letter dated 05.07.2021 (Annexure No.37-C) whereby the decision taken by the Board\nin its 70th Meeting along with other decisions was communicated to the petitioner. A prayer\ncommanding YEA to re-schedule and re-compute the balance dues and to decide the representation\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148801015/                                                                4                     M/S Jai Prakash Associates Ltd vs State Of U.P. And Another on 10 March, 2025\n\ndated 02.03.2021 has also been made.\n\nCASE OF THE PETITIONER (JAL) :\n\n5. The Government of Uttar Pradesh constituted Taj Express Industrial Development Authority (in\nshort 'TEA') vide notification dated 24.04.2001 under the U.P. Industrial Area Development Act,\n1976 (in short 'the Act, 1976') for implementing the Yamuna Expressway Project and allied\ndevelopments in the region. The responsibilities of the erstwhile TEA, inter alia, include execution of\nYamuna Expressway, acquisition of land for construction of the expressway area, development and\npreparation of zonal plan/ master plan for planned development along the expressway, development\nof drainage, feeder roads, electrification etc. In exercise of powers conferred upon TEA under the\nAct of 1976 and in furtherance of discharge of its essential functions, YEA brought a policy of Special\nDevelopment Zone (in short 'SDZ') contemplating setting up of SDZs with a particular core activity\nchosen by the entrepreneur out of the options specified. On 29.02.2008, YEA invited applications\nfrom the interested parties by widely publishing the SDZ policy through circulation of a detailed\nbrochure containing various terms and conditions. The petitioner applied in response to the notice\nfor setting up of the SDZ with \"sports\" as its core activity. At the time of applying, it was JPSK Sports\nPvt Ltd which was, later on, named as Jaypee Sports International Ltd (JPSI) which subsequently\nmerged into the petitioner-company in the year 2014 pursuant to a scheme of merger. YEA, vide\nletter dated 11.06.2008, issued an allocation letter to the petitioner communicating the latter that\nYEA had decided to allocate an area of 1000 hectares of land for setting up SDZ with \"Sports\" as the\ncore activity.\n\n6. On 28.08.2008, YEA informed the petitioner that it had reserved land measuring approximately\n1000 hectares in Sector 25, Noida for the petitioner to develop SDZ with sports as the core activity.\nIt was informed that the land had been reserved in anticipation of respondent no.2 taking\npossession over the land for which acquisition proceedings were in progress. In between years 2009\nand 2011, YEA issued six allotment letters dated 24.02.2009, 20.03.2009, 10.08.2009, 27.01.2010,\n23.06.2010 and 07.12.2010 to the petitioner and the land measuring 1085.3327 hectares, inclusive\nof 98.9862 hectares for village development and abadi extension, and 14.6673 hectares was allotted\nto it. All the allotment letters, being similar in nature, contained a payment schedule, the area of the\nland allotted and installments fixed for payment of the premium .\n\n7. In between the same period of time, subsequent to the six allotment letters and payment of 20%\na...",

    "facts_of_case": "as taken from AY 2005-06 are that the assessee had debited a sum of Rs. 4.24 crores towards 'assets written off' and the same was included under the head 'provisions and write off was debited to the P&L A/c. Out of the said amount, the assessee had added back a sum of Rs. 4,09,97,398/- in the income computation statement as the same did not represent an allowable deduction in arriving at the total income as per the provisions of the IT Act. The balance amount of Rs. 14,54,302/- had not been added back by the assessee in the income computation statement. In this regard it was mentioned in Col. 17(a) of the tax audit report enclosed to the return that the said balance amount represents the value of work-in progress written off and that the same is eligible for deduction. 5.1 The AO after considering the submissions of the assessee and analyzed the issue elaborately with case law, inter-alia, observed that the contentions of the assessee in this regard are treated as untenable and held that the deduction claimed for the expenditure represented by mine development work-in-progress written off due to closure of the mine is not in accordance with the and accordingly, disallowed the assessee's claim of deduction amounting to Rs. 14,54,302/-, which was confirmed by t h e C I T ( A ) w h e n t h e a s s e s s e e p r e f e r r e d a n a p p e a l b e f o r e h i m . ..................................................................... 5.4 We have considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record as well as gone through the orders of revenue authorities. We find that substance in the ITA Nos 283 284 286 and 300 301 and 308 of 2024 Singareni Collieries Company Ltd submissions made by the ld. AR. From the orders of the authorities below, it is clear that the assessee has debited to the capital expenditure in the P&L account in respect of those mines which are not in operation or the mines were unsuccessful for coal mines. It is also clear that the breakups were filed before the CIT(A) which has been incorporated by him in his order. We find that in most of the cases mines were closed and no operations could be carried out, the capital work in progress relating to that mine development expenditure could not be capitalized. Therefore, the capital work in progress relating to the mine development expenditure incurred was written off since no asset could be created. Any expenditure which does not bring any additional advantage to the business of the assessee is revenue expenditure. The Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68677544/ 31 Dcit, Circle-13(1), Hyderabad vs The Singareni Collieries Company ... on 12 June, 2025 expenditure was basically of revenue nature and incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business. The assessee had also filed detailed written submissions before the CIT(A) and had relied on number of judgments. Before us, the ld. AR also relied on the judgments as quoted supra. In support of our decision, we rely on the following judgements: 5.4.1 In case of CIT Vs. Binani Cements Ltd., vs CIT - 380 ITR 116 (Calcutta HC). In ITA No. 265 OF 2009, judgment dated 23/03/2015, similar issue was decided by the Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta wherein it has held as under: \"3. Mr. Bajoria, learned senior advocate, appearing for the appellant submitted that the question is partly covered by the decision in CIT v. Graphite India Ltd. [1996] 221 ITR 420 (Cal.). The relevant question referred by the Tribunal to this Court in that case was whether in the facts and circumstances of that case, the Tribunal was justified in holding that the expenditure incurred for the assessee's proposed Petro-chemical project was revenue expenditure and to be allowed as a deduction? This Court in answering the question, held as follows: \"So far as question No. 4 is concerned, the Tribunal recorded the finding that the assessee spent an amount of Rs. 56,665 as project expenditure. The expenditure represented fees paid to Engineering India Ltd. in connection with the petrochemical project report. The amount was paid by the assessee in order to explore the possibility of setting up of a petro-chemical project which could provide a captive plant for manufacture of raw material at the assessee's own factory which would help the assessee in getting continuous supply of raw material even during periods of acute shortage. In fact, the project did not materialize. The ITO as well as the CIT(A), therefore, held that the expenditure was capital in nature. However, the Tribunal found that the expenditure did not result in ITA Nos 283 284 286 and 300 301 and 308 of 2024 Singareni Collieries Company Ltd bringing into existence any capital asset of enduring in nature. The Tribunal further found that the decision of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Hindustan Aluminum Corporation Ltd. v. CIT (1986) 55 CTR (Cal.) 237: (1986) 159 ITR 673 (Cal) was applicable and following that",

Ground Nos.1 to 4 for the A.Y 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2020-21 of the assessee's appeals are\ncommon and involving the issue of disallowance of payment/grant made to Singareni Educational\nSociety u/s 40A(9) of the I.T. Act, 1961. For the A.Y 2015-16, the assessee has claimed the deduction\nof Rs.37,39,77,452/- towards grant made to Singareni Educational Society. The Assessing Officer\nasked the assessee to show cause as to why this expenditure should not be disallowed by invoking\nthe provisions of section 40A(9) of the Act. In response the assessee submitted that the said\neducational society is a body constituted for running educational institutions established by the\nassessee for the benefit of its employees. The entire infrastructure required by the socitt was\nprovided by the assessee and therefore, the entire expenditure of the society over and above the\ngrant received from government and fees collected is met by the assessee. The assessee company\nfunds gap in the expenditure incurred by the society by deducting the grant in aid received from the\ngovernment and fee collected by the society. Thus, the assessee submitted that the expenditure\nincurred by it is for reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the educational society towards\nadministrative and other operating expenses. The assessee also pointed out that the assessee is\nunder the obligation as per the National Coal Wages Agreement (NCWA) entered into between the\nmanagement of the assessee and the joint bipartite committee of Coal Industry (JBCCI) which\nconsists of representative of State Govt, representative of the Central Govt and Members of various\nrecognized trade unions. The Assessing Officer did not accept this contention of the assessee and\ndisallowed the said claim of deduction u/s 40A(9) of the Act.\n\nITA Nos 283 284 286 and 300 301 and 308 of 2024 Singareni Collieries Company Ltd\n\n3. The assessee challenged the action of the Assessing Officer before the learned CIT (A) but could\nnot succeed.\n\n4. Before the Tribunal, the learned Counsel for the assessee submitted that the assessee is engaged\nin the business of extraction and sale of coal and power generation in the State of Telangana. The\nassessee is primarily governed by Mines Act, 1952. The operation of the assessee are spread across\nvarious remote area in the State of Telangana. In view of the compelling working conditions under\nwhich the workers of the assessee are working, the assessee provides with certain welfare benefits to\nthe employees/workers and their family members/children. The service conditions of the workers\nand employees of the assessee are governed by the National Coal Wages Agreement (NCWA) and\ntherefore, the assessee was under the obligation to establish infrastructure like, hospital,\neducational institutions and township etc. for its employees as per the employment terms to make\navailable good manpower who are willing to stay in the remote areas. Earlier, the assessee had used\nto run schools and colleges for their employees incurring expenditure, however, in the year 1999, the\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68677544/                                                                 2                            Dcit, Circle-13(1), Hyderabad vs The Singareni Collieries Company ... on 12 June, 2025\n\nassessee formed an educational society namely Singareni Educational Society to run the schools and\ncolleges more efficiently. Thus, the grant made by the assessee towards making up the shortfall of\nthe funds of the educational society after considering the grant-in-aid received from the govt. and\nfees collected for the expenditure incurred in education to the employees/children of the employees.\nThe learned Counsel for the assessee has further submitted that the NCWA is a recognized\nagreement having a binding effect in the terms of the definition of \"settlement\" under the provisions\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, ITA Nos 283 284 286 and 300 301 and 308 of 2024 Singareni\nCollieries Company Ltd 1947 as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mohan Mahto vs.\nCentral Coal Field Ltd (2007) (8) SCC 549. Thus, the learned Counsel for the assessee has submitted\nthat the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the NCWA is a statutory document and it has binding\nforce of law so far its enforceability is concerned. He has further submitted that the provisions of\nsection 40A(9) of the Act are not attracted in the case of the assessee as this expenditure is not\nincurred directly or indirectly for setting up or formation or towards contribution to any funds,\ntrust, society etc., but it was only an expenditure towards providing educational facility to the\nemployees as well as local public residing in the area. The learned Counsel for the assessee has\npointed that this issue is covered by the decision of the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court in\nassessee's own case for the A.Ys 2006-07 to 008-09 respectively in ITTA Nos. 85, 87 and 88 of 2021,\ndated 15/02/2024 whereby the issue has been decided in favour of the assessee.\n\n5. On the other hand, the learned DR has submitted that the educational society is an independent\nentity and maintaining separate books of account. He has referred to the income & expenditure\naccount placed at page No.36 of the paper book and submitted that the said society is not only\nproviding education to the employees of the assessee but to the other local residents in the area and\ntherefore, the expenditure incurred by the assessee cannot be considered as laid out wholly and\nexclusively for the purpose of the business of the assessee. He has relied upon the orders of the\nAssessing Officer as well as the learned CIT (A).\n\nITA Nos 283 284 286 and 300 301 and 308 of 2024 Singareni Collieries Company Ltd\n\n6. We have considered the rival contentions as well as the relevant material available on record. The\nAssessing Officer has disallowed the claim of the assessee by holding that the payment in question\nmade by the assessee to the educational society would not be an allowable expenses u/s 40A(9) of\nthe I.T. Act, 1961 as this payment is not made for the expenses provided u/s 36(1)(iv) &(iv) of the\nAct. The relevant finding in para 9.2 are as under:\n\n7. The learned CIT (A) has confirmed the order of the Assessing Officer. At the outset, we note that\nthis issue has been now considered and decided by the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court in\nassessee's own case for the A.Ys 2006-07 to 2008-09 vide judgment dated 15/02/2024 in ITTA\nNo.85,87 and 88 of 2021 in para 10 to 17 as under:\n\n       \"10. The contention of the Assessing Officer was that firstly, the benefit so provided\n      being a welfare measure, the expenditure would fall squarely within the ambit of\n      Clause E of sub-section 2 of Section 115WB and hence, it become...",

    "facts_of_case": "to the police which I came to know. Cross-examination: 4. It is true that I was sitting on the Otla (Platform outside the house) with my husband. I sit on the platform on that day only. The incident happened about five feet away from the place where we sit. It took five mintes to gather the people there. We got scarred but did not go back in the house and Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5471726/ 29 Manovarkhan @Manukhan ... vs State Of Gujarat on 27 February, 2025 stood there only. They broght swords and sticks within two minutes. By the time the said persons went to take the weapons, my son did not try to escape but he stood there. We did not try to go in the house. It is true that I had not dictated in my police statement that 'My son requested with folded hands that I do not want to quarrel'. Around fifteen to twenty blows might have been given to my son.

With regards to the addition of Rs. 12,80,100/-, we are of the considered view that the IT(SS)A No.535/ahd/2019 & 13 Others ACIT vs. M/s.Benefit Tradelink Ltd. & Others Asst. Years : 2011-12 to 2015-16 addition has been made on the basis of incriminating materials found during the course of search (as per our detailed discussion in the preceding paragraphs). 105. However, the assessee has raised the additions ground / arguments that out of the above sum, addition of Rs. 11,84,100/- has already been made in the hands of the husband of the assessee and accordingly, it would amount to double addition if this amount is again added in the hands of the assessee. 106. Accordingly, in the interest of justice, the matter is restored to the file of Ld. CIT(A) to carry out necessary verification to see if this amount has also been added in the hands of the assessee's husband and if that be the case, appropriate relief may be afforded to the assessee. 107. With respect to balance additions, we are of the considered view that Ld. CIT(A) has correctly observed that since the same have not been made on the basis of incriminating materials found during the course of search (we observe that this addition shad been made on the basis of return of income, books of accounts filed by the assessee and verification of ITS data etc.), the additions are liable to be deleted in view of the decisions of Saumya Construction and other judicial precedents which have consistently held that in case of an unabated assessment year, no additions made in the hands of the assessee which are not on the basis of incriminating materials found during the course of search. Accordingly, Department's appeal with respect to these balance additions is dismissed. IT(SS)A No.535/ahd/2019 & 13 Others ACIT vs. M/s.Benefit Tradelink Ltd. & Others Asst.

    "facts_of_case": "as taken from AY 2005-06 are that the assessee had debited a sum of Rs. 4.24 crores towards 'assets written off' and the same was included under the head 'provisions and write off was debited to the P&L A/c. Out of the said amount, the assessee had added back a sum of Rs. 4,09,97,398/- in the income computation statement as the same did not represent an allowable deduction in arriving at the total income as per the provisions of the IT Act. The balance amount of Rs. 14,54,302/- had not been added back by the assessee in the income computation statement. In this regard it was mentioned in Col. 17(a) of the tax audit report enclosed to the return that the said balance amount represents the value of work-in progress written off and that the same is eligible for deduction. 5.1 The AO after considering the submissions of the assessee and analyzed the issue elaborately with case law, inter-alia, observed that the contentions of the assessee in this regard are treated as untenable and held that the deduction claimed for the expenditure represented by mine development work-in-progress written off due to closure of the mine is not in accordance with the and accordingly, disallowed the assessee's claim of deduction amounting to Rs. 14,54,302/-, which was confirmed by t h e C I T ( A ) w h e n t h e a s s e s s e e p r e f e r r e d a n a p p e a l b e f o r e h i m . ..................................................................... 5.4 We have considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record as well as gone through the orders of revenue authorities. We find that substance in the ITA Nos 283 284 286 and 300 301 and 308 of 2024 Singareni Collieries Company Ltd submissions made by the ld. AR. From the orders of the authorities below, it is clear that the assessee has debited to the capital expenditure in the P&L account in respect of those mines which are not in operation or the mines were unsuccessful for coal mines. It is also clear that the breakups were filed before the CIT(A) which has been incorporated by him in his order. We find that in most of the cases mines were closed and no operations could be carried out, the capital work in progress relating to that mine development expenditure could not be capitalized. Therefore, the capital work in progress relating to the mine development expenditure incurred was written off since no asset could be created. Any expenditure which does not bring any additional advantage to the business of the assessee is revenue expenditure. The Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39239445/ 31 Singareni Collieries Company ... vs Acit., Circle-1, Khammam on 12 June, 2025 expenditure was basically of revenue nature and incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business. The assessee had also filed detailed written submissions before the CIT(A) and had relied on number of judgments. Before us, the ld. AR also relied on the judgments as quoted supra. In support of our decision, we rely on the following judgements: 5.4.1 In case of CIT Vs. Binani Cements Ltd., vs CIT - 380 ITR 116 (Calcutta HC). In ITA No. 265 OF 2009, judgment dated 23/03/2015, similar issue was decided by the Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta wherein it has held as under: \"3. Mr. Bajoria, learned senior advocate, appearing for the appellant submitted that the question is partly covered by the decision in CIT v. Graphite India Ltd. [1996] 221 ITR 420 (Cal.). The relevant question referred by the Tribunal to this Court in that case was whether in the facts and circumstances of that case, the Tribunal was justified in holding that the expenditure incurred for the assessee's proposed Petro-chemical project was revenue expenditure and to be allowed as a deduction? This Court in answering the question, held as follows: \"So far as question No. 4 is concerned, the Tribunal recorded the finding that the assessee spent an amount of Rs. 56,665 as project expenditure. The expenditure represented fees paid to Engineering India Ltd. in connection with the petrochemical project report. The amount was paid by the assessee in order to explore the possibility of setting up of a petro-chemical project which could provide a captive plant for manufacture of raw material at the assessee's own factory which would help the assessee in getting continuous supply of raw material even during periods of acute shortage. In fact, the project did not materialize. The ITO as well as the CIT(A), therefore, held that the expenditure was capital in nature. However, the Tribunal found that the expenditure did not result in ITA Nos 283 284 286 and 300 301 and 308 of 2024 Singareni Collieries Company Ltd bringing into existence any capital asset of enduring in nature. The Tribunal further found that the decision of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Hindustan Aluminum Corporation Ltd. v. CIT (1986) 55 CTR (Cal.) 237: (1986) 159 ITR 673 (Cal) was applicable and following that",

Ground Nos.1 to 4 for the A.Y 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2020-21 of the assessee's appeals are\ncommon and involving the issue of disallowance of payment/grant made to Singareni Educational\nSociety u/s 40A(9) of the I.T. Act, 1961. For the A.Y 2015-16, the assessee has claimed the deduction\nof Rs.37,39,77,452/- towards grant made to Singareni Educational Society. The Assessing Officer\nasked the assessee to show cause as to why this expenditure should not be disallowed by invoking\nthe provisions of section 40A(9) of the Act. In response the assessee submitted that the said\neducational society is a body constituted for running educational institutions established by the\nassessee for the benefit of its employees. The entire infrastructure required by the socitt was\nprovided by the assessee and therefore, the entire expenditure of the society over and above the\ngrant received from government and fees collected is met by the assessee. The assessee company\nfunds gap in the expenditure incurred by the society by deducting the grant in aid received from the\ngovernment and fee collected by the society. Thus, the assessee submitted that the expenditure\nincurred by it is for reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the educational society towards\nadministrative and other operating expenses. The assessee also pointed out that the assessee is\nunder the obligation as per the National Coal Wages Agreement (NCWA) entered into between the\nmanagement of the assessee and the joint bipartite committee of Coal Industry (JBCCI) which\nconsists of representative of State Govt, representative of the Central Govt and Members of various\nrecognized trade unions. The Assessing Officer did not accept this contention of the assessee and\ndisallowed the said claim of deduction u/s 40A(9) of the Act.\n\nITA Nos 283 284 286 and 300 301 and 308 of 2024 Singareni Collieries Company Ltd\n\n3. The assessee challenged the action of the Assessing Officer before the learned CIT (A) but could\nnot succeed.\n\n4. Before the Tribunal, the learned Counsel for the assessee submitted that the assessee is engaged\nin the business of extraction and sale of coal and power generation in the State of Telangana. The\nassessee is primarily governed by Mines Act, 1952. The operation of the assessee are spread across\nvarious remote area in the State of Telangana. In view of the compelling working conditions under\nwhich the workers of the assessee are working, the assessee provides with certain welfare benefits to\nthe employees/workers and their family members/children. The service conditions of the workers\nand employees of the assessee are governed by the National Coal Wages Agreement (NCWA) and\ntherefore, the assessee was under the obligation to establish infrastructure like, hospital,\neducational institutions and township etc. for its employees as per the employment terms to make\navailable good manpower who are willing to stay in the remote areas. Earlier, the assessee had used\nto run schools and colleges for their employees incurring expenditure, however, in the year 1999, the\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39239445/                                                                 2                           Singareni Collieries Company ... vs Acit., Circle-1, Khammam on 12 June, 2025\n\nassessee formed an educational society namely Singareni Educational Society to run the schools and\ncolleges more efficiently. Thus, the grant made by the assessee towards making up the shortfall of\nthe funds of the educational society after considering the grant-in-aid received from the govt. and\nfees collected for the expenditure incurred in education to the employees/children of the employees.\nThe learned Counsel for the assessee has further submitted that the NCWA is a recognized\nagreement having a binding effect in the terms of the definition of \"settlement\" under the provisions\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, ITA Nos 283 284 286 and 300 301 and 308 of 2024 Singareni\nCollieries Company Ltd 1947 as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mohan Mahto vs.\nCentral Coal Field Ltd (2007) (8) SCC 549. Thus, the learned Counsel for the assessee has submitted\nthat the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the NCWA is a statutory document and it has binding\nforce of law so far its enforceability is concerned. He has further submitted that the provisions of\nsection 40A(9) of the Act are not attracted in the case of the assessee as this expenditure is not\nincurred directly or indirectly for setting up or formation or towards contribution to any funds,\ntrust, society etc., but it was only an expenditure towards providing educational facility to the\nemployees as well as local public residing in the area. The learned Counsel for the assessee has\npointed that this issue is covered by the decision of the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court in\nassessee's own case for the A.Ys 2006-07 to 008-09 respectively in ITTA Nos. 85, 87 and 88 of 2021,\ndated 15/02/2024 whereby the issue has been decided in favour of the assessee.\n\n5. On the other hand, the learned DR has submitted that the educational society is an independent\nentity and maintaining separate books of account. He has referred to the income & expenditure\naccount placed at page No.36 of the paper book and submitted that the said society is not only\nproviding education to the employees of the assessee but to the other local residents in the area and\ntherefore, the expenditure incurred by the assessee cannot be considered as laid out wholly and\nexclusively for the purpose of the business of the assessee. He has relied upon the orders of the\nAssessing Officer as well as the learned CIT (A).\n\nITA Nos 283 284 286 and 300 301 and 308 of 2024 Singareni Collieries Company Ltd\n\n6. We have considered the rival contentions as well as the relevant material available on record. The\nAssessing Officer has disallowed the claim of the assessee by holding that the payment in question\nmade by the assessee to the educational society would not be an allowable expenses u/s 40A(9) of\nthe I.T. Act, 1961 as this payment is not made for the expenses provided u/s 36(1)(iv) &(iv) of the\nAct. The relevant finding in para 9.2 are as under:\n\n7. The learned CIT (A) has confirmed the order of the Assessing Officer. At the outset, we note that\nthis issue has been now considered and decided by the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court in\nassessee's own case for the A.Ys 2006-07 to 2008-09 vide judgment dated 15/02/2024 in ITTA\nNo.85,87 and 88 of 2021 in para 10 to 17 as under:\n\n       \"10. The contention of the Assessing Officer was that firstly, the benefit so provided\n      being a welfare measure, the expenditure would fall squarely within the ambit of\n      Clause E of sub-section 2 of Section 115WB and hence, it becomes taxable.

    "facts_of_case": "leading to the present appeal in a nut-shell are as under: That the respondents herein were appointed on contractual basis for a period of eleven months on a fixed salary and on a particular project, namely, \"Post-Earthquake Redevelopment Programme\" of the Government of Gujarat. That the respondents herein were initially appointed for a period of eleven months in the year 2004 to the post of drivers. On closure of the project in which the respondents were appointed, instead of terminating the services of the respondents herein, the State Government took a decision to place them in the services of Indian Red Cross Society. Instead of joining the duties in the Indian Red Cross Society, the respondents approached the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/60873967/ 52 Raval Pankeshbhai Manilal vs State Of Gujarat on 12 June, 2025 High Court by filing Writ Petition No. 17328/2011 for regularisation of their services and NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/13821/2015 JUDGMENT DATED: 12/06/2025 undefined absorption in Government service. The original writ petitioners also challenged their placement with the Indian Red Cross Society. 2.1 The learned Single Judge vide order dated 25.11.2011 dismissed the said writ petition by observing that the appointment of the original writ petitioners was only for eleven months on a fixed salary, which has been continued from time to time, and the unit in which they were appointed temporarily was a \"Project Implementation Unit\" only for the purpose of rehabilitation pursuant to the earthquake for the \"Post- Earthquake Redevelopment Programme\" and they were not regularly appointed on any permanent sanctioned posts in any establishment of the Government where the writ petitioners have any lien. 2.2 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petition, the respondents herein - original writ petitioners preferred LPA No. 2082/2011 before the Division Bench of the High Court. By an interim order dated 20.12.2011, respondents herein were continued in service with the State Government and they were not even transferred to the Indian Red Cross Society. The said LPA came up for hearing before the Division Bench in the year 2021. Before the Division Bench, it was submitted on behalf of the respondents herein - original writ petitioners that as they have been continuously working in the Government Departments and they have not been transferred to Indian Red Cross Society and since they have by now working for NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/13821/2015 JUDGMENT DATED: 12/06/2025 undefined seventeen years, the Government may be directed to consider the case for regularisation in the service as long period has passed. 2.3 By the impugned judgment and order, the Division Bench of the High Court has directed the State/Department to consider the cases of the respondents herein for absorption and regularisation sympathetically and if necessary, by creating supernumerary posts, solely on the ground that the respondents herein - original writ petitions by now have worked for seventeen years. 2.4 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court, the State has preferred the present appeal. 10. The Division Bench has also not appreciated the fact and/or considered the fact that the respondents were initially appointed for a period of eleven months and on a fixed salary and that too, in a temporary unit - \"Project Implementation Unit\", which was created only for the purpose of rehabilitation pursuant to the earthquake for \"Post-Earthquake Redevelopment Programme\". Therefore, the unit in which the respondents were appointed was itself a temporary unit and not a regular establishment. The posts on which the respondents were appointed and working Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/60873967/ 53 Raval Pankeshbhai Manilal vs State Of Gujarat on 12 June, 2025 were not the sanctioned posts in any regular establishment of the Government. 13. Now, so far as the reliance placed upon the decision NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/13821/2015 JUDGMENT DATED: 12/06/2025 undefined of this Court in the case of Umadevi (supra) and the subsequent decision of this Court in the case of Narendra Kumar Tiwari (supra), relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents is concerned, none of the aforesaid decisions shall be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. The purpose and intent of the decision in Umadevi (supra) was, (1) to prevent irregular or illegal appointments in the future, and (2) to confer a benefit on those who had been irregularly appointed in the past and who have continued for a very long time. The decision of Umadevi (supra) may be applicable in a case where the appointments are irregular on the sanctioned posts in regular establishment. The same does not apply to temporary appointments made in a project/programme.\" 21. It further emerges that the reliance placed by M...",

That the Assessment Order passed in pursuance to the directions issued by the\n      Learned Dispute Resolution Panel ('DRP') is a vitiated order as the Ld. DRP has erred\n      both on facts and in law, in not considering the submissions made by the Appellant\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16407970/                                                                 1                            Akzo Nobel India Ltd., Gurgaon vs Dcit, New Delhi on 10 July, 2018\n\n      and in confirming the addition made by the Ld. Assessing Officer ('AO')/ Ld. Transfer\n       Pricing Officer ('TPO') to the Appellant's income.\n\n        2. That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld. AO [following\n       the directions of Learned Dispute Resolution Panel (\"Ld. DRP\")] erred in assessing\n       the returned loss of the appellant of Rs.49,664,891 at the income of Rs. 65,58,117.\n\n        3. The Ld. Transfer Pricing officer (TPO)/ Ld.DRP erred on facts and circumstances\n       of the case and in law by confirming an Transfer Pricing adjustment amounting to\n     INR 56,223,008 holding that the international transaction pertaining to provision of\n       contract research and development services ('R&D segment') do not satisfy the arm's\n       length principle envisaged under the Act and in doing so have grossly erred in:\n\n       3.1 not appreciating that the Appellant had prepared the Transfer Pricing\n      documentation bona fide and in good faith in compliance with the provisions of\n       Section 92D of the Act read with Rule 10D of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 ('Rules')\n      and selected uncontrolled comparable companies based on a detailed Functional,\n       Asset and Risk ('FAR') analysis, following a methodical and consistent benchmarking\n       process in respect of contract research and development services. 3.2 rejecting the\n      arm's length margin computed by the Appellant for contract research and\n      development services segment using multiple year / average data and instead of\n       using current year data for comparable companies, i.e., data for FY 2008-09, Akzo\n      Nobel India Ltd.\n\ndespite the fact that the same was not available with the Appellant at the time of preparing its\ntransfer pricing documentation.\n\n3.3 ignoring the comparability analysis undertaken by the Appellant for its contract research and\ndevelopment services and thereby performing his own comparability analysis in making adjustment\nto the transfer price of the Appellant.\n\n3.4 ignoring the limited risk nature of the contract research and development services provided by\nthe Appellant and in not providing an appropriate adjustment towards the risk differential.\n\n3.5 denying the benefit of (+/-) 5% range mentioned in the proviso to Section 92C(2) of the Act in\ndetermination of the arms length price.\n\n4. The Ld. Transfer Pricing officer (TPO)/ Ld.DRP erred in considering the payment of Rs.\n41,942,829 by the Appellant towards the administrative services received from the Associated\nEnterprises(\"AEs\") to be 'Nil', and in doing so grossly erred in law and in facts for the following\nreasons:\n\n        4.1 applying the Comparable Uncontrolled Price method and rejecting the application\n       of Transactional Net Margin Method as most appropriate method for determination\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16407970/                                                                 2                            Akzo Nobel India Ltd., Gurgaon vs Dcit, New Delhi on 10 July, 2018\n\n        of arm's length price in case of payment of administration fee.\n\n       4.2 drawing conclusion as regards to no economic value was derived and that no\n       tangible and substantial commercial benefit was derived out of services for which the\n      admin fee was paid.\n\n       4.3 disregarding the collective evidences provided in justification of the arms length\n       nature of international transactions pertaining to the payment of administration fee.\n       4.4 the support services are in the nature of stewardship as it result into benefit to the\n     AEs and such coordination actuary is required to be carried out by the parent\n      companies to improve its global presence and global profit.\n\nAkzo Nobel India Ltd.\n\n5. The Ld. AO/ Ld. DRP erred in enhancing the income of the Appellant on account of interest on\noverdue receivables by Rs. 11,56,859 without stating any cogent reasons and basis for interest\ncalculation. The Ld TPO grossly erred in charging interest to the receivables which were outstanding\nin ordinary course of business and has been collected in a reasonable period and in doing so grossly\nerred in law and in facts for the following reasons:\n\n        5.1 applying an arbitrary interest rate of 14.25 percent (lending rate of SBI plus 150\n       basis points) for calculating interest on outstanding receivables.\n\n       5.2 not considering the fact that the amount outstanding in the name of AEs\n       represents the normal course of business activity and looking into the commercial\n      expediency of the business, this situation prevails for both receipts and payments\n       to/from the AEs.\n\n        6. That the Ld. AO has grossly erred in law in levying interest under section 234D of\n       the Act and also withdrawing interest under section 244A of the Act.\n\n        7. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld. AO erred in\n        initiating penalty proceedings under section 271(1)(c), 271AA and 271BA of the Act.\n\nThat the above grounds of appeal are independent and without prejudice to each other.\n\nThat the appellant reserves its right to add, alter, amend or withdraw any ground of appeal either\nbefore or at the time of hearing of this appeal.\"\n\n4. The assessee also moved an application dated 05.04.2018 under Rule 11 of the Income Tax\n(Appellate Tribunal) Rules, 1963 for admission of the additional ground by stating as under:\n\n      \"Re: Request for admission of additional ground of appeal under Rule 11 of the\n      Income Tax (Appellate Tribunal) Rules, 1963.\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16407970/                                                                 3                            Akzo Nobel India Ltd., Gurgaon vs Dcit, New Delhi on 10 July, 2018\n\n      Akzo Nobel India Ltd.\n\n      The Appellant requests to allow raising of the following ground of appeal in addition\n       to those filed for adjudication before the Hon'ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal\n       (\"Hon'ble Bench\"):\n\n            .\n\n       8. That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in taw, the orders passed by\n       the Assessing Officer (\"AO\") / Dispute Resolution Panel (\"DRP\") / Transfer Pricing\n       Officer (\"TPO\") are bad in law and void ab initio as the same have been passed on a\n       non-existent entity, namely Akzo Nobel Car Refinishes India Private Limited.\n\nThe brief facts giving rise to the aforesaid ground of appeal are stated hereunder:\n\n      The Appellant was incorporated on December 5, 1997 as a wholly owned subsidiary of\n      Akzo Nobel Coatings International BV, Netherlands.

    "facts_of_case": "IN CRL.A.577/2024 37. This appeal arises from FIR No. 113/2017 which initially related to the alleged attempted murder of one Mr. Jagdish Kumar Gagneja by two unknown motorcyclists. who were on a motorcycle, by use of firearms around 8 pm on 6th August 2016. He was travelling with his wife in his 'Swift' car and had stopped at the road crossing behind the Jyoti Chowk Market, Jalandhar to attend nature's call when he was shot. He was stated to be the then Vice President of RSS for the State of Punjab and an active member of the said organization. 38. The said FIR was registered by PS Division Number 04 District Jalandhar, Punjab under Section 307, 34 IPC of 1860 read with 25, 27, 54, and 59 of the Arms Act 1956. 39. The attempt to kill the deceased Mr. Jagdish Kumar Gagneja was subsequently identified to be a part of a larger transnational conspiracy involving a series of eight incidents intended to destabilize the law and order situation in Punjab. Considering the gravity of the offence, this FIR was transferred to Central Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter 'CBI') on 7th September 2016 and was re-registered as RC-10(S)/2016/SCU.V/SC- II/CBI/New Delhi. The victim succumbed to the injuries on 20th September 2016. 40. Subsequently, this FIR was again transferred to the N.I.A on 8th March, 2019 and was re-registered as RC Number 07/2019/N.I.A/DLI. There are a total of twenty persons who are accused in this case. The Appellant is one of the accused. The Appellant was booked under Section 120-B of the IPC of 1860 and Sections 16 17, 18 of the Act. COMMON FACTS AS PER THE N.I.A REPORTS 41. The actual shooters in both the incidents were allegedly Hardeep Singh (1) and Ramandeep Singh (A-2) in both cases. The allegation is that they carried out a series of targeted killings during the period 2016-2017 in Ludhiana and Jalandhar Districts of Punjab. As per the reports of the N.I.A, the killing of the deceased by the masked youths is established by independent witnesses. On the basis of the investigation and the information received, A- 1- Hardeep Singh and A-2- Ramandeep Singh were both arrested on 21st December 2017. In their interrogation, it is claimed that they gave details of the eight incidents, in which they were involved. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27044979/ 20 Jagtar Singh Johal @ Jaggi vs National Investigation Agency on 18 September, 2024 42. According to the N.I.A, the eight incidents in which they were involved were specifically for creating a law and order situation in Punjab. There was no previous animosity between the deceased victims and the shooters. The case of the N.I.A was that the accused persons are part of a conspiracy hatched by the Khalistan Liberation Force (hereinafter 'KLF') of which the Appellant is also a member. 43. As per the Reports one of the shooters A-1 - Hardeep Singh used to live with his paternal uncle (Tayaji) and his wife in Italy. A-3 - Harminder Singh @ Mintoo, one of the self-acclaimed leaders of Khalistan Liberation Force, had stayed as a guest in their house in Italy and during his interaction with Hardeep Singh, he started motivating him for committing violence in the name of Khalistan. It was during his stay there that he received 3000 GBP from the Appellant - Jagtar Singh Johal (A-6). It is claimed in the N.I.A's report that the Appellant is a close confidant of A-14-Harmeet Singh @ PhD and A-16-Gursharan Singh @ Gursharanveer and that the Appellant had delivered the said 3000 GBP to A-3-Harminder Singh on behalf of A-16. It is further alleged in the report that Appellant is a member of the KLF, who had complete knowledge of the conspiracy. The remaining portions of the report are not relevant for the present purposes. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT 44. The two main grounds urged on behalf of the Appellant are - a. That the Appellant has a limited role to play and b. Secondly that the Appellant has been incarcerated for a long period on unsubstantiated allegations. 45. Mr. Paramjeet Singh, ld. Counsel for the Appellant submits that the entire charge-sheet mentions the Appellant only in two paragraphs. The relevant portions of the charge-sheet are set out below: \"17.27 In between his stay at Daljit Singh's house, Gurjinder Singh@ Shastri (A-15), Harminder Singh @ Mintoo (A-5) and Hardeep Singh (A-1) took a tour of France and Germany by road.

The relationship between the parties was purely of a consensual nature. The relationship, as noted above, was in existence prior to the marriage of the second respondent and continued to subsist during the term of the - 56 - NC: 2025:KHC:21007 HC-KAR marriage and after the second respondent was granted a divorce by mutual consent.\" 17.

I have\n      mother, father and a brother. My mother Name Is Pratima, Father's Is shyamal,\n       Brother is Subhojeet.\n\n        I am the elder one. This is to inform you that I have been into a relationship from\n      2018 with a guy named Saurabh Kant, when I was studying MCA in TI, we met\n      through common friends in Kolkata. He was working in TCS, Kolkata. We fall in love,\n     we really liked each other and we were serious about each other. He has assured me\n      and committed to marriage from starting only and specifically in the month of Dec\n      2023. He told we both love each other and anyway we are going to be together (In\n        fact I told him that we should do it after marriage) I feel he will definitely marry with\n     me and so willingly we got intimated. His brother and sister in law met my family\n     members as well. First time we got intimated in year April 2023 in Ananda Reddy\n       layout with a commitment to marriage, he did it. Last time we got intimated was\n      July/August 2023. So I too have a confidence on him. I was asking him to make me\n        talk to his family, he said his father is ill (he is suffering from blood cancer) and his\n      mother is not considering for marriage though I am trying my best. In Fact I told\n      him, to do registry marriage as well, he mentioned that his father will get heart attack\n          if someday he came to know that. He was on my feet one day sating that its better if\n     my parents would have died earlier, I NC: 2025:KHC:21007 HC-KAR won't not have\n       to face these consequences. After seeing him going through all this, I gave him time,\n       to convince his family. I went to my hometown by August 2023, I was doing WFH.\n      (Work From Home) Till Nov we were in contact, he sends me gifts, wishes me Diwali\n      and all. When I continuously started forcing him to talk make his parents talk to me,\n      he started pointing out finger on my character, on my parents finances and said that\n       his father has certain demands to get fulfil in marriage. He humiliated me to that\n      extend that I drop him a message stating that you are not in the mood of solving\n       things between us and get married. After seeing my message he again called me and\n        talk and told me I am going to my hometown will talk to my family, and will solve\n       everything. Infact he told me that I am so much irritated from my family that think I\n       should have make you pregnant so that my family don't left with an option and made\n     me marry you.\n\n       After going to his hometown he completely stop talking to me I dropped messages,\n       called him, no reply came. Suddenly one day(Feb 2024) I came to know he is\n      engaged. Immediately I called him he said he has taken the decision, when I asked\n     him what you were doing with me, are you with me to fulfil your desire, he again\n       started pointing out fingers on my character. I asked my mother to call him he\n      mentioned I have to do this for my family, because of my father, when my mother\n       questioning him, he again started doing the same.

    "facts_of_case": "not only of what the parties agree to have happened but also of what plainly did happen, even though the parties do not agree. The most compendious statement known to me of the judicial process involved in assessing the credibility of an oral witness is to be found in the dissenting speech of Lord Pearce in the House of Lords in Onassis v Vergottis [1968] 2 Lloyds Rep 403 at p 431. In this, he touches on so many of the matters which I wish to mention that I may perhaps be forgiven for citing the relevant passage in full: ''Credibility' involves wider problems than mere 'demeanour' which is mostly concerned with whether the witness appears to be telling the truth as he now believes it to be. Credibility covers the following problems. First, is the witness a truthful or untruthful person? Secondly, is he, though a truthful person telling something less than the truth on this issue, or though an untruthful person, telling the truth on this issue? Thirdly, though he is a truthful person telling the truth as he sees it, did he register the intentions of the conversation correctly and, if so has his memory correctly retained them? Also, has his recollection been subsequently altered by unconscious bias or wishful thinking or by over much discussion of it with others? Witnesses, especially those who are emotional, and who think that they are Neutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:11339-DB ) morally in the right, tend very easily and unconsciously to conjure up a legal right that did not exist. It is a truism, often used in accident cases, that with every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active. For that reason, a witness, however honest, rarely persuades a Judge that his present recollection is preferable to that which was taken down in writing immediately after the accident occurred. Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance. And lastly, although the honest witness believes he heard or saw this or that, is it so improbable that it is on balance more likely that he was mistaken? On this point, it is essential that the balance of probability is put correctly into the scales in weighing the credibility of a witness. And motive is one aspect of probability. All these problems compendiously are entailed when a Judge assesses the credibility of a witness; they are all part of one judicial process. And in the process, contemporary documents and admitted or incontrovertible facts and probabilities must play their proper part.\" Every judge is familiar with cases in which the conflict between the accounts of different witnesses is so gross as to be inexplicable save on the basis that one or some of the witnesses are deliberately Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146615957/ 12 State Of Himachal Pradesh vs Raju Ram on 14 November, 2024 giving evidence which they know to be untrue . . .. more often dishonest evidence is likely to be prompted by the hope of gain, the desire to avert blame or criticism, or misplaced loyalty to one or other of the parties. The main tests needed to determine whether a witness is lying or not are, I think, the following, although their relative importance will vary widely from case to case: (1) the consistency of the witness's evidence with what is agreed, or clearly shown by other evidence, to have occurred; Neutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:11339-DB ) (2) the internal consistency of the witness's evidence; (3) consistency with what the witness has said or deposed on other occasions; (4) the credit of the witness in relation to matters not germane to the litigation; (5) the demeanour of the witness. The first three of these tests may in general be regarded as giving a useful pointer to where the truth lies. If a witness's evidence conflicts with what is clearly shown to have occurred or is internally self- contradictory, or conflicts with what the witness has previously said, it may usually be regarded as suspect. It may only be unreliable, and not dishonest, but the nature of the case may effectively rule out that possibility. The fourth test is perhaps more arguable. . . .\" 35. The following guidance of Lord Goff in Grace Shipping v. Sharp & Co [1987] 1 Lloyd's Law Rep. 207 at 215-6 is also helpful. \"And it is not to be forgotten that, in the present case, the Judge was faced with the task of assessing the evidence of witnesses about telephone conversations which had taken place over five years before. In such a case, memories may very well be unreliable; and it is of crucial importance for the Judge to have regard to the contemporary documents and the overall probabilities.

Yes.\n\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:11339-DB ) same manner as they were arrayed before the learned\nTrial Court for convenience).\n\n2. Briefly stated, the facts giving rise to the present appeal are that the police presented a challan\nagainst the accused before the learned Trial Court for the commission of an offence punishable\nunder Section 20 of the ND&PS Act. It was asserted that SI Raj Kumar (PW9), HC Mohinder Singh\n(PW2), HHC Lachman Dass, and Constable Jai Singh (PW1) were present at Shamshar Chowk in\nthe official vehicle bearing registration No. HP34A-3830 being driven by Constable Mukesh Kumar\non 02.07.2013.

The\naccused revealed his name as Raju Ram on enquiry. The accused was carrying a backpack (Ext. P2).\nThe place was lonely and deserted. The police waited for the independent witnesses but none came.\nHence, the police officials were associated as witnesses. SI Raj Kumar (PW9) informed the accused\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146615957/                                                                1                                   State Of Himachal Pradesh vs Raju Ram on 14 November, 2024\n\nthat he had a legal right to be searched before a Magistrate or the Gazetted Officer. The accused\nconsented to be searched by the police. A consent memo (Ext.PW-1/A) was prepared. SI Raj Kumar\n(PW9) gave his personal search to the Neutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:11339-DB ) accused,\nnothing incriminating was found in his possession. Memo (Ext. PW-1/B) was prepared. The police\nchecked the backpack and found black spheres in it. The accused revealed that spheres (Ext.P3)\nwere charas. SI Raj Kumar (PW9) also checked the spheres and found them to be charas. The weight\nof charas was found to be 1 kg 700 grams. The charas was put in the backpack. The backpack was\nput in a cloth parcel (Ext.P1) and the parcel was sealed with six impressions of seal 'O'. The seal\nimpression (Ext. PW-1/C) was taken on a separate piece of cloth. NCB-1 Form (Ext. PW-7/C) was\nfilled in triplicate. A seal impression was put on the NCB-1 Form.

He handed\nover the case property, sample seal, and NCB-1 Form to Constable Pritam Singh (PW3) with the\ndirection to carry them to SFSL Junga, vide R.C. No. 45 of 2013 (Ext. PW-7/B). Constable Pritam\nSingh (PW3) deposited all the articles at SFSL Junga and handed over the receipt to HC Lokinder\nSingh (PW-7) on his return. SI Raj Kumar (PW9) prepared the special report (Ext. PW-5/A) and\nhanded it over to HHC Chande Ram (PW4) with the directions to carry it to SDPO Ani. HHC\nChande Ram (PW-4) handed over the special report on 03.07.2013 to SDPO. SDPO made the\nendorsement on the special report and handed it over to his Reader. LHC Bhuvneshwari (PW5)\nmade the entry in the register (Ext. PW-5/B) and retained the special report on record. The result of\nthe analysis (Ext. PW-8/A) was issued in which it was mentioned that the exhibit was an extract of\ncannabis and a sample of charas. Statements of the remaining witnesses were recorded as per their\nversion and after the completion of investigation, the challan was prepared and presented before the\nlearned Trial Court.\n\n3. The learned Trial Court charged the accused with the commission of an offence punishable under\nSection 20 of the Neutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:11339-DB ) ND&PS Act, to which the accused\npleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n4. The prosecution examined nine witnesses to prove its case. Constable Jai Singh (PW1), and HC\nMohinder Singh (PW2) are the official witnesses to the recovery. Constable Pritam Singh (PW3)\ncarried the case property to SFSL, Junga. HHC Chande Ram (PW4) carried the special report to\nSDPO Ani. LHC Bhuvneshwari (PW5) was posted as Reader to SDPO to whom the special report\nwas handed over. HHC Santosh Kumar (PW6) brought the case property and the result of analysis\nfrom SFSL, Junga. HC Lokinder Singh (PW7) was posted as MHC to whom the rukka and the case\nproperty were handed over. SHO Rohit Mrigpuri (PW8) conducted the partial investigation and\nprepared the chargesheet. SI Raj Kumar (PW9) effected the recovery and conducted the\ninvestigation.\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146615957/                                                                2                                   State Of Himachal Pradesh vs Raju Ram on 14 November, 2024\n\n5. The accused in his statement recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. denied the prosecution case in\nits entirety. He stated that he was taken from his home by the police after threatening him with a\nrevolver. He was innocent. The statement of Chaman Lal (DW-1) was recorded in defence.\n\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:11339-DB )\n\n6. The learned Trial Court held that the testimonies of police officials did not inspire confidence.\nThere were discrepancies in the statements of the prosecution witnesses due to which it was difficult\nto rely upon them. The independent witnesses were not associated and the contradictions became\nsignificant in their absence. The seal was not produced before the Court which would further cast\ndoubt upon the prosecution case. The defence version that the accused was arrested from his home\nand brought to the police station was probable, therefore, the accused was acquitted.\n\n7. Being aggrieved from the judgment passed by the learned Trial Court, the State has filed the\npresent appeal asserting that the learned Trial Court failed to properly appreciate the evidence led\nbefore it. The official witnesses had supported the prosecution case and learned Trial Court erred in\nignoring the testimonies of the official witnesses. Minor contradictions were blown out of proportion\nand these were not sufficient to discredit the statements of the prosecution witnesses. The\nnon-production of the seal before the Court was not fatal. The accused was apprehended at a\nsecluded place and no independent witnesses could have been joined. Therefore, it was prayed that\nthe present Neutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:11339-DB ) appeal be allowed and the judgment\npassed by the learned Trial Court be set aside.\n\n8. We have heard Mr Varun Chandel, learned Additional Advocate General for the appellant/State\nand Ms Ritta Goswami, learned Senior Advocate assisted by Ms Komal Chaudhary, learned counsel\nfor the respondent/accused.\n\n9. Mr Varun Chandel, learned Additional Advocate General for the appellant/State submitted that\nthe learned Trial Court erred in acquitting the accused. The accused was apprehended at 4 AM at a\nlonely place and there was no possibility of the association of independent witnesses. The minor\ncontradictions in the statements of the official witnesses were not sufficient to discredit them as the\ncontradictions are bound to come with time. The non-production of the seal before the Court is not\nfatal and the learned Trial Court erred in acquitting the accused on the ground of non-production of\nthe seal. Hence, he prayed that the present appeal be allowed. He relied upon the judgments of\nSathyan versus State of Kerala SLP (Crl.) No. 9710/2023 and Sohan Lal vs. State of Himachal\nPradesh Criminal Appeal No. 305 of 2014 decided on 02.11.2016 in support of his submission.\n\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:11339-DB )\n\n10. Ms Ritta Goswami, learned Senior Advocate for the respondent/accused supported the judgment\npassed by the learned Trial Court. She submitted that the non-association of independent witnesses\nis fatal to the prosecution case. There was non-compliance with the provisions of Section 55 of the\nND&PS Act because the case property was not resealed by the SHO. There is a discrepancy in the\ncase property stated to be recovered on the spot and the case property analyzed in th...",

Briefly stated, the facts giving rise to the present appeal are that the police presented a challan\nagainst the accused before the learned Trial Court for the commission of an offence punishable\nunder Section 20 of the ND&PS Act. It was asserted that ASI Dheeraj (PW8), ASI Jai Lal, ASI\nMukesh, HC Gopal Chand (PW6), and Constable Rajnish Kumar were present at Ramshila near\nBhootnath Temple, Kullu on 22.10.2010 at about 4:30 am for patrolling.

ASI Dheeraj checked the sticks and found them to be charas. The\nweight of the charas was found to be 400 grams. The charas was re-packed in the same manner in\nwhich it was recovered.

HC Gopal Chand (PW6) is a witness to the recovery. SI Tej Ram\n(PW7) prepared the challan. ASI Dheeraj Kumar (PW8) conducted the investigation and effected the\nrecovery.\n\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:11231 )\n\n5. The accused in his statement recorded under Section 313 of Cr. P.C. denied the prosecution case\nin its entirety. He stated that he was innocent and the witnesses deposed against him falsely. He did\nnot lead any defence evidence.\n\n6. Learned Trial Court held that the accused was given the option to be searched before a Magistrate\nor the Gazetted Officer but he chose to be searched by the police. This was sufficient compliance\nwith the requirement of Section 50 of the ND&PS Act. The independent witnesses could not have\nbeen associated as the recovery was effected at 4:30 AM. The report of the analysis was not proper\nand it was not proved that the accused was found in possession of charas. Hence, the accused was\nacquitted.\n\n7. Being aggrieved from the judgment passed by the learned Trial Court, the State has filed the\npresent appeal asserting that the learned Trial Court erred in acquitting the accused. It was rightly\nheld that the recovery and seizure of contraband from the possession of the accused was proved. It\nwas wrongly held that the report of the analysis was not sufficient to prove that the substance\nrecovered from the possession of the accused was charas. The report of SFSL, Junga clearly showed\nthat the sample was of charas which contained 29.03% W/W resin in it. Therefore, it was prayed\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:11231 ) that the present appeal be allowed and the judgment\npassed by the learned Trial Court be set aside.\n\n8. We have heard Mr. S.D. Vasudeva learned Deputy Advocate General for the appellant/State and\nMr Virender Thakur, Advocate for the respondent/accused.\n\n9. Mr. S.D. Vasudeva, learned Deputy Advocate General for the appellant/State submitted that the\nlearned Trial Court erred in acquitting the accused on the ground that the contraband was not\nproved to be charas. The judgment of this Court relied upon by the learned Trial Court has been\noverruled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Hira Singh versus Union of India 2020 SCC online SC\n382. Therefore, he prayed that the present appeal be allowed and the judgment passed by the\nlearned Trial Court be set aside.\n\n10. Mr. Virender Thakur, learned counsel for the respondent/accused supported the judgment\npassed by the learned Trial Court.

J., DELIVERED THE\n       FOLLOWING:\n\n\n\n       CORAM:    HON'BLE MRS JUSTICE K.S.MUDAGAL\n                 AND\n                 HON'BLE MR JUSTICE VIJAYKUMAR A. PATIL\n\n\n\n                               CAV JUDGMENT\n\n(PER: HON'BLE MRS JUSTICE K.S.MUDAGAL) These two appeals arise out of the common\njudgment and order/decree dated 28.09.2020 in M.C.Nos.1100/2015 and 4772/2016 passed by the\nPrl. Judge, Family Court, Bengaluru.\n\n2. The appellant in these cases was the petitioner in M.C.No.1100/2015 and respondent in\nM.C.No.4772/2016. The respondent in these cases was the respondent in M.C.No.1100/2015 and\npetitioner in M.C.No.4772/2016. M.C.No.1100/2015 was filed by the appellant against the\nrespondent under Section 13(1)(ia) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (for short 'the Act') seeking decree\nfor dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty. The present respondent NC:\n2024:KHC:29448-DB filed MC No.4772/2016 against the appellant under Section 9 of the Act\nseeking decree for restitution of conjugal rights.\n\n3. The marriage of the appellant and respondent was solemnized on 13.11.2011 at Unity Hall,\nThirthahalli as per the Hindu rights. The marriage was subsequently registered before the Sub\nRegistrar of Marriages, Sagar. During their conjugal life the couple were blessed with a son by name\nVihan on 19.02.2013. Appellant is a Mechanical Engineer and at the time of marriage was employed\nat Bengaluru. Subsequently he is working in Pune. Respondent is a civil engineer. At the time of\nmarriage, she was also employed in Bengaluru.\n\n4. In M.C.No.1100/2015 decree for dissolution of marriage was sought alleging following acts of\ncruelty:\n\n          i) That the respondent was abuser since the beginning of the marriage itself. Being\n       the eldest son, the appellant had the duty to help his parents and family. However,\n       that was disliked by the respondent. Whenever he helped his parents, she used to\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/78391201/                                                                 2                                          Sri Chandrashekara B T vs Smt. Rajini H J on 26 July, 2024\n\n     become violent and assault him, abuse him, his parents and family members in\n       vulgar language. During nights she used to shout at him hit, pinch and punch him.\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:29448-DB\n\nii) In June 2012 he lost his father. Therefore, he used to visit his mother regularly at Thirthahalli.\nThat was also objected by the respondent. She wanted the appellant to cut all his connection with his\nmother and younger brother.\n\niii) After postnatal care respondent refused to return to matrimonial home. However, after some\ntime, she returned to their house in Bengaluru posing several conditions. On the request of his\nmother on 21.11.2013 the appellant rendered financial assistance of Rs.2,00,000/- to his mother. On\nlearning about the same on 23.11.2013 during night the respondent abused the appellant, in the fit\nof anger she assaulted him with kitchen knife and fork on his head, shoulder and back causing him\nsevere injuries. On taking treatment in K.C.General hospital, Bengaluru he filed complaint against\nher. As a counter blast to the same, she filed complaint against him, his brother and friend before\nthe Vyalikaval Police Station. Further she filed a false dowry harassment complaint before the\nHalasurugate Women Police Station against the appellant, his parents and relatives. She never\ntreated him gracefully as a spouse. Her conduct has subjected him to immense cruelty NC:\n2024:KHC:29448-DB making it impossible to continue the marital life. Hence he be granted decree\nfor dissolution of marriage.\n\n5. The respondent contested the petition denying the allegations of cruelty and the instances alleged\nby him. She claimed that at the time of marriage, cash of Rs.5,00,000/-, gold chain, gold ring and\nbracelet were given to the appellant as dowry. During her pregnancy also the appellant despite\nhaving sufficient means neglected to take care of her. Four to five months after marriage, the\nappellant at the instigation of his brother, mother and maternal uncle subjected her to physical and\nmental cruelty in connection with demand for additional dowry. The appellant did not even meet\nthe domestic exigencies. The advise of elders did not yield any result. The allegation of assault of\n23.11.2013 was denied. It was contended that when she did not yield to the demand of the appellant\nfor dowry of Rs.10,00,000/- the appellant himself at the instigation of his mother and brother\nassaulted her seriously. Since the child was sleeping she could not file the complaint immediately.\nTo overcome his misdeeds he filed the complaint against her. After the incident he left home and did\nNC: 2024:KHC:29448-DB not return and deserted her and the child without any reasonable cause.\nHence she sought dismissal of the petition.\n\n6. On the same grounds she filed MC No.4772/2016 seeking decree for restitution of conjugal rights\nand that petition was opposed by the appellant reiterating the grounds taken in M.C.No.1100/2015.\n\n7. The Trial Court consolidated both the matters and recorded common evidence in\nM.C.No.1100/2015. The appellant was examined as PW.1 and on his behalf Exs.P1 to P11 were\nmarked. The respondent was examined as RW.1. On her behalf Ex.R1 to R23 were marked. The trial\nCourt on hearing the parties by the impugned judgment and order dismissed M.C.No.1100/2015\nholding that the cruelty alleged was not proved, allowed M.C.No.4772/2016 and ordered for\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/78391201/                                                                 3                                          Sri Chandrashekara B T vs Smt.

It is the case of\n\n\n       the prosecution that the 2nd respondent with her husband one Bipin\n                                        4\n\n\n\n\n\n       Therat Sethumadhavan and two children - Master Xxxxx aged\n\n\n       about 13 years and Miss.

The complainant and the family come to reside at\n\n\n       the neighbouring villa.

The\n\n\n       children   drawn    by    the   lure   of   colors    and     creativity,\n\n\n       frequently visited the house of the complainant, so did the\n\n\n       victim.

The 2nd respondent/complainant and the family is said to\n\n\n       have decided to settle down in Dubai. Therefore, they vacated the\n\n\n       Villa on 22-08-2020 and went Dubai.

The\n\n\n       crux of the complaint was that, the victim boy throughout the 4\n\n\n       years in Dubai was not active and had psychological changes in\n\n\n       him. When the mother confronted the son, the victim boy is said to\n\n\n       have confessed that the petitioner had called him to her house for\n\n\n       four or five months on a continuous basis, between February and\n\n\n       June 2020 and the conversation initially began and led to\n\n\n       downloading some art pictures on Instagram and the petitioner had\n\n\n       then taken him to her bedroom, unrobed herself and also the victim\n\n\n       and asked the boy to commit the act of intercourse on her and after\n\n\n       that is said to have sent him threatening, that if he would reveal\n\n\n       anything to anybody, it would be dangerous to both of them. This is\n\n\n       the beginning of the activity.\n                                         6\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175231186/                                                                4                                 Smt.

Thereafter, on 17-05-2020 on another occasion, a girl by\n\n\n       name Shreya had come to the house of the petitioner and,\n\n\n       therefore, the victim boy also goes there and on that day after\n\n\n       sending the girl Sherya out, the victim boy was again subjected to\n\n\n       sexual abuse by the petitioner. The complaint then becomes a\n\n\n       crime in crime No.533 of 2024 for offences punishable under\n\n\n       Sections 4 and 6 of the Act.

The matter was\n\n\n       heard and reserved for its judgment on 12-06-2025.

The said FIR was registered by PS Division Number 04 District Jalandhar, Punjab under Section 307, 34 IPC of 1860 read with 25, 27, 54, and 59 of the Arms Act 1956. 39. The attempt to kill the deceased Mr. Jagdish Kumar Gagneja was subsequently identified to be a part of a larger transnational conspiracy involving a series of eight incidents intended to destabilize the law and order situation in Punjab. Considering the gravity of the offence, this FIR was transferred to Central Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter 'CBI') on 7th September 2016 and was re-registered as RC-10(S)/2016/SCU.V/SC- II/CBI/New Delhi. The victim succumbed to the injuries on 20th September 2016. 40. Subsequently, this FIR was again transferred to the N.I.A on 8th March, 2019 and was re-registered as RC Number 07/2019/N.I.A/DLI. There are a total of twenty persons who are accused in this case. The Appellant is one of the accused. The Appellant was booked under Section 120-B of the IPC of 1860 and Sections 16 17, 18 of the Act. COMMON FACTS AS PER THE N.I.A REPORTS 41. The actual shooters in both the incidents were allegedly Hardeep Singh (1) and Ramandeep Singh (A-2) in both cases. The allegation is that they carried out a series of targeted killings during the period 2016-2017 in Ludhiana and Jalandhar Districts of Punjab. As per the reports of the N.I.A, the killing of the deceased by the masked youths is established by independent witnesses. On the basis of the investigation and the information received, A- 1- Hardeep Singh and A-2- Ramandeep Singh were both arrested on 21st December 2017. In their interrogation, it is claimed that they gave details of the eight incidents, in which they were involved. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12666342/ 20 Jagtar Singh Johal @ Jaggi vs National Inestigation Agency on 18 September, 2024 42. According to the N.I.A, the eight incidents in which they were involved were specifically for creating a law and order situation in Punjab. There was no previous animosity between the deceased victims and the shooters. The case of the N.I.A was that the accused persons are part of a conspiracy hatched by the Khalistan Liberation Force (hereinafter 'KLF') of which the Appellant is also a member. 43. As per the Reports one of the shooters A-1 - Hardeep Singh used to live with his paternal uncle (Tayaji) and his wife in Italy. A-3 - Harminder Singh @ Mintoo, one of the self-acclaimed leaders of Khalistan Liberation Force, had stayed as a guest in their house in Italy and during his interaction with Hardeep Singh, he started motivating him for committing violence in the name of Khalistan. It was during his stay there that he received 3000 GBP from the Appellant - Jagtar Singh Johal (A-6). It is claimed in the N.I.A's report that the Appellant is a close confidant of A-14-Harmeet Singh @ PhD and A-16-Gursharan Singh @ Gursharanveer and that the Appellant had delivered the said 3000 GBP to A-3-Harminder Singh on behalf of A-16. It is further alleged in the report that Appellant is a member of the KLF, who had complete knowledge of the conspiracy. The remaining portions of the report are not relevant for the present purposes. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT 44. The two main grounds urged on behalf of the Appellant are - a. That the Appellant has a limited role to play and b. Secondly that the Appellant has been incarcerated for a long period on unsubstantiated allegations. 45. Mr. Paramjeet Singh, ld.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183077514/ 20 Jagtar Singh Johal @ Jaggi vs National Investigation Agency on 18 September, 2024 42. According to the N.I.A, the eight incidents in which they were involved were specifically for creating a law and order situation in Punjab. There was no previous animosity between the deceased victims and the shooters. The case of the N.I.A was that the accused persons are part of a conspiracy hatched by the Khalistan Liberation Force (hereinafter 'KLF') of which the Appellant is also a member. 43. As per the Reports one of the shooters A-1 - Hardeep Singh used to live with his paternal uncle (Tayaji) and his wife in Italy. A-3 - Harminder Singh @ Mintoo, one of the self-acclaimed leaders of Khalistan Liberation Force, had stayed as a guest in their house in Italy and during his interaction with Hardeep Singh, he started motivating him for committing violence in the name of Khalistan. It was during his stay there that he received 3000 GBP from the Appellant - Jagtar Singh Johal (A-6). It is claimed in the N.I.A's report that the Appellant is a close confidant of A-14-Harmeet Singh @ PhD and A-16-Gursharan Singh @ Gursharanveer and that the Appellant had delivered the said 3000 GBP to A-3-Harminder Singh on behalf of A-16. It is further alleged in the report that Appellant is a member of the KLF, who had complete knowledge of the conspiracy. The remaining portions of the report are not relevant for the present purposes. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT 44. The two main grounds urged on behalf of the Appellant are - a.

    "facts_of_case": "of the present case. It was contended that even prima facie, the essential ingredients of the alleged offences under the UA(P) Act have not been made out. 195. The learned counsel also drew our attention to the allegations against the co-Accused(s), Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, and submitted that there is similarity in the allegations made against the Appellants with these co-accused persons. He submitted that, as per the Prosecution‚s own case, Devangana and Natasha were involved in managing protest sites at Seelampur and Jafrabad and had also visited other protest locations. Thus, it was submitted that as the alleged role of the Appellants is not greater than, and may be even lesser than that of co-accused Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, who have been enlarged on bail by this Court, and especially in view the fact that the Appellants have been languishing behind bars for more than 5 years, and there is no likelihood of the trial concluding in the near future, the Appellants deserve to be enlarged on bail. CRL.A. 184/2022 & CONNECTED MATTERS 18:10:56 SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE:- 196. The learned SPP submitted that the conduct of the Appellants clearly demonstrates their involvement in the present case, as they were engaged in creating protest sites and delivering inflammatory speeches not only in the Capital but also in different parts of the country. He argued that the Appellants actively played their role in the larger conspiracy and facilitated its execution. The investigating agency, he asserted, has collected sufficient material to implicate them in the offences for which they have been charge- sheeted. 197. The learned SPP further referred to the Statement of various witnesses in order to highlight the Appellants‚ involvement in the conspiracy and the ensuing violence. Protected Witness-Venus, he submitted, in his statement under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C., stated that the Appellants were part of the main umbrella body, that is, DPSG, and further stated that the Appellants-Shadab Ahmed, Athar Khan, and Saleem Khan, alongwith others, started the anti-CAA/NRC protests near his residence and were present amongst those who engaged in violence against the police and the public, leading to the attack on DCP (Shahdara), ACP Gokulpuri, and HC Rattan Lal, who was killed in the incident that took place on the Wazirabad main road. 198. The learned SPP further argued that the Appellant-Abdul Khalid, alongside co-conspirator Umar Khalid, both being members of UAH, attended the Jantar Mantar protest on 07.12.2019, with other co-accused CRL.A. 184/2022 & CONNECTED MATTERS 18:10:56 persons, which is evident Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156202283/ 49 Sharjeel Imam vs The State Of Nct Of Delhi on 2 September, 2025 from his CDR location. He submitted that this Appellant was also a part of the CAB TEAM and the CAB WhatsApp group. He submitted that the CDR location corroborates the fact that he had attended the agitation organized against the CAA at Jantar Mantar on 07.12.2019. 199. The learned SPP further argued that Protected witness-Johny and Bravo have stated about the presence of the Appellants-Athar Khan, Shadab Ahmad, Saleem Khan, in the meeting on 16/17.02.2020 at 2:00 A.M., scheduled at Chand Bagh, pertaining to causing disruptive chakka jaams to confront and to use violence. 200. Relying on the statement of Pluto, he further submitted that the Appellants attended a secret meeting on the night of 20/21.02.2020, and their conversations, along with other co-accused, were heard by this witness when he had gone to deliver biryani to one Ayyaz‚s basement office at Chand Bagh. According to Pluto, plans were being discussed to \"burn Delhi\" using firearms, petrol, and other means, and funds had already been arranged for the said purpose. 201. He further submitted that the Protected Witnesses- Radium and Sodium have also stated that during these meetings, there were open discussions regarding escalation of violence and setting parts of Delhi on fire. It was also discussed that arrangements were being made for funds, firearms, and petrol bombs to be used for killing people and committing acts of arson. CRL.A. 184/2022 & CONNECTED MATTERS 18:10:56 202. The learned SPP submitted that the Appellant-Abdul Khalid, on 23.02.2020, along with the co-accused Ishrat Jahan, shifted from the Khureji protest site to the main Patparganj Road and blocked this arterial road in a mixed population area. He submitted that another protected witness- Peter, has also deposed to this effect. He further submitted that, later on the same day, that is, on 23.02.2020, they converted this disruptive Chakka-Jaam into a violent attack on police personnel and non-Muslims by using firearms and other deadly weapons. An FIR No. 44/2020 was registered at P.S. Jagat Puri in this regard. 203. The learned SPP contended that on 23rd February, 2020, the Appellants- Shadab Ahmed, Saleem Khan, and Salim Malik @ Munna moved from...",

J., DELIVERED THE\n       FOLLOWING:\n\n\n\n       CORAM:    HON'BLE MRS JUSTICE K.S.MUDAGAL\n                 AND\n                 HON'BLE MR JUSTICE VIJAYKUMAR A. PATIL\n\n\n\n                               CAV JUDGMENT\n\n(PER: HON'BLE MRS JUSTICE K.S.MUDAGAL) These two appeals arise out of the common\njudgment and order/decree dated 28.09.2020 in M.C.Nos.1100/2015 and 4772/2016 passed by the\nPrl. Judge, Family Court, Bengaluru.\n\n2. The appellant in these cases was the petitioner in M.C.No.1100/2015 and respondent in\nM.C.No.4772/2016. The respondent in these cases was the respondent in M.C.No.1100/2015 and\npetitioner in M.C.No.4772/2016. M.C.No.1100/2015 was filed by the appellant against the\nrespondent under Section 13(1)(ia) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (for short 'the Act') seeking decree\nfor dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty. The present respondent NC:\n2024:KHC:29448-DB filed MC No.4772/2016 against the appellant under Section 9 of the Act\nseeking decree for restitution of conjugal rights.\n\n3. The marriage of the appellant and respondent was solemnized on 13.11.2011 at Unity Hall,\nThirthahalli as per the Hindu rights. The marriage was subsequently registered before the Sub\nRegistrar of Marriages, Sagar. During their conjugal life the couple were blessed with a son by name\nVihan on 19.02.2013. Appellant is a Mechanical Engineer and at the time of marriage was employed\nat Bengaluru. Subsequently he is working in Pune. Respondent is a civil engineer. At the time of\nmarriage, she was also employed in Bengaluru.\n\n4. In M.C.No.1100/2015 decree for dissolution of marriage was sought alleging following acts of\ncruelty:\n\n          i) That the respondent was abuser since the beginning of the marriage itself. Being\n       the eldest son, the appellant had the duty to help his parents and family. However,\n       that was disliked by the respondent. Whenever he helped his parents, she used to\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6498898/                                                                  2                                           Sri Chandrashekara B T vs Smt Rajini H J on 26 July, 2024\n\n     become violent and assault him, abuse him, his parents and family members in\n       vulgar language. During nights she used to shout at him hit, pinch and punch him.\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:29448-DB\n\nii) In June 2012 he lost his father. Therefore, he used to visit his mother regularly at Thirthahalli.\nThat was also objected by the respondent. She wanted the appellant to cut all his connection with his\nmother and younger brother.\n\niii) After postnatal care respondent refused to return to matrimonial home. However, after some\ntime, she returned to their house in Bengaluru posing several conditions. On the request of his\nmother on 21.11.2013 the appellant rendered financial assistance of Rs.2,00,000/- to his mother. On\nlearning about the same on 23.11.2013 during night the respondent abused the appellant, in the fit\nof anger she assaulted him with kitchen knife and fork on his head, shoulder and back causing him\nsevere injuries. On taking treatment in K.C.General hospital, Bengaluru he filed complaint against\nher. As a counter blast to the same, she filed complaint against him, his brother and friend before\nthe Vyalikaval Police Station. Further she filed a false dowry harassment complaint before the\nHalasurugate Women Police Station against the appellant, his parents and relatives. She never\ntreated him gracefully as a spouse. Her conduct has subjected him to immense cruelty NC:\n2024:KHC:29448-DB making it impossible to continue the marital life. Hence he be granted decree\nfor dissolution of marriage.\n\n5. The respondent contested the petition denying the allegations of cruelty and the instances alleged\nby him. She claimed that at the time of marriage, cash of Rs.5,00,000/-, gold chain, gold ring and\nbracelet were given to the appellant as dowry. During her pregnancy also the appellant despite\nhaving sufficient means neglected to take care of her. Four to five months after marriage, the\nappellant at the instigation of his brother, mother and maternal uncle subjected her to physical and\nmental cruelty in connection with demand for additional dowry. The appellant did not even meet\nthe domestic exigencies. The advise of elders did not yield any result. The allegation of assault of\n23.11.2013 was denied. It was contended that when she did not yield to the demand of the appellant\nfor dowry of Rs.10,00,000/- the appellant himself at the instigation of his mother and brother\nassaulted her seriously. Since the child was sleeping she could not file the complaint immediately.\nTo overcome his misdeeds he filed the complaint against her. After the incident he left home and did\nNC: 2024:KHC:29448-DB not return and deserted her and the child without any reasonable cause.\nHence she sought dismissal of the petition.\n\n6. On the same grounds she filed MC No.4772/2016 seeking decree for restitution of conjugal rights\nand that petition was opposed by the appellant reiterating the grounds taken in M.C.No.1100/2015.\n\n7. The Trial Court consolidated both the matters and recorded common evidence in\nM.C.No.1100/2015. The appellant was examined as PW.1 and on his behalf Exs.P1 to P11 were\nmarked. The respondent was examined as RW.1. On her behalf Ex.R1 to R23 were marked. The trial\nCourt on hearing the parties by the impugned judgment and order dismissed M.C.No.1100/2015\nholding that the cruelty alleged was not proved, allowed M.C.No.4772/2016 and ordered for\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6498898/                                                                  3                                           Sri Chandrashekara B T vs Smt Rajini H J on 26 July, 2024\n\nrestitution of conjugal rights holding that the respondent has proved that the appellant without\nreasonable excuse has deserted her.

There is no force in the decrees of Venice.\n\n        I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?\n\n       1.Act 4 Scene 1, The Merchant of Venice Williams Shakespeare In The Merchant of\n       Venice, Shakespeare portrays Shylock, standing before the court of Venice, insisting\n       that Antonio’s bond be strictly enforced, despite appeals from the Duke and others\n       for leniency. His steadfast demand for literal enforcement of the bond — ignoring\n       broader notions of fairness and equity — resonates even today.\n\nIf that portrayal were to find a parallel in the present case, it would be in the stance adopted by the\nsecond respondent, the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Ltd. (TASMAC), which similarly\nseeks to insist on rigid positions in disregard of broader legal and equitable obligations.\n\n2.If there is one entity today to which this critique squarely applies, it is the 2nd Respondent – the\nTamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited (TASMAC). Established as a Government\ncompany in 1983 during the tenure of the then Chief Minister, Thiru M.G. Ramachandran, TASMAC\nwas https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/04/2025 08:04:20 pm ) originally\nenvisioned as a regulatory mechanism to oversee liquor sales and to curb the menace of illicit liquor.\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/57631592/                                                                 3                Tasmac Oozhiyar Manila Sammelanam ... vs The Government Of Tamilnadu on 29 April, 2025\n\nIt has grown into a Leviathan and is attempting to ward off any legal control of any laws. Bolstered\nby the substantial revenue it generates, TASMAC appears to be resisting the applicability of general\nlegal norms, routinely disregarding binding judicial precedents and treating court directives with\nevident indifference. This judgment would simultaneously examine the manner in which this\nCourt’s orders concerning TASMAC employees and the application of labour laws have been\nrepeatedly disregarded by the Corporation—conduct which, if not outright contemptuous, certainly\nverges on it.\n\n3.Before dealing into the labour legislations applicable to TASMAC, it is apposite to trace the\nhistorical context of prohibition in this State. The Prohibition Act, 1937 was enacted during the\npremiership of Shri C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji) in the erstwhile Madras Presidency. The legislative\nintent behind this enactment was the enforcement of total prohibition, notwithstanding the\nsignificant fiscal implications arising from the loss of excise revenue. The Act wa...",

This Miscellaneous Civil Application is filed by the Applicant-husband under Section (\"u/s\") 24 of\nthe Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (\"CPC\") to transfer the Application filed by the Respondent-wife u/s\n12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (\"PWDV Act\") of from\nMetropolitan Magistrate's 62nd Court, Bhoiwada, Mumbai to Family Court, Bandra, Mumbai.\n\n2. The Applicant-husband and Respondent-wife got married on 23rd December 2001 at Mumbai.\nOut of wedlock there are two daughters born; one on 26th October 2002 and another 19th\nSeptember 2005. Both are major now. Though the couple resided in USA initially, they returned to\nIndia in 2008. Eighteen years into their marriage, in or around 2019, the couple decided to separate\non account of marital discord. The respondent-wife left for USA on 25th October 2021 with the\nintention to seek divorce and maintenance before the Supreme Court of New Jersey. The\nrespondent-wife's application before the US Court was dismissed on the preliminary ground of\njurisdiction.\n\n3. On the other hand, Applicant-husband filed for divorce u/s 13(1) (ia) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955\nby filing Marriage Petition bearing No. A-347 of 2021 before the Family Court, Mumbai.\n\n4. On being served with the Marriage Petition, the Respondent- wife decided to seek maintenance\nfor herself and their children through an Interim Application (IA) in the Marriage Petition before\nthe Family Court. Aggrieved by the Applicant-husband action, the 20th December 2023 Rohan Shah\nvs. Nishigandha Shah MCA-477-2022 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes\nOrder dated 23/02/2024 J.doc Respondent-wife filed an application under Section 12(1) and sought\nreliefs u/s 18 to 22 of PWDV Act before the Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on 25th July 2022.\n\n5. Ms Irani, Learned Counsel for the Applicant-husband, urged that the Respondent-wife returned\nto India from USA only after eight months. She had made an Application before the US Court only\nwith an intent to pressurise the Applicant-husband to pay her higher maintenance and adhere to her\nterms. She failed there and although she had sought maintenance by making an Interim Application\non 27th June 2022 before the Family Court, Mumbai, on 25th July 2022 only with an intent to\nharass the Applicant- husband she chose to also file an Application bearing No. DV/107 of 2022\nunder Section 12 before the Metropolitan Magistrate's Court.\n\n6. She submitted that the reliefs sought in the Metropolitan Magistrate Court are similar to her\nApplication for interim maintenance before the Family Court. According to her the transfer would\nobviate dual arguments in different forums, for the same reliefs, on same facts, between the same\nparties and probably even prevent conflicting views and findings. Thus, both parties could not only\navoid two different trials in different Courts but also the expenses attached to it. This exercise would\nalso avoid multiplicity of proceedings and thus she submitted that in the interest of all concerned,\nthe Court ought to transfer the proceedings. She submitted that no prejudice would be caused if the\nproceedings from Metropolitan Magistrate Courts were transferred to the Family Court. In this\nbackdrop, she submitted that the transfer 20th December 2023 Rohan Shah vs. Nishigandha Shah\nMCA-477-2022 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 23/02/2024\nJ.doc Application be allowed and the Application before the Metropolitan Magistrate Court be\ntransferred to the Family Court.

In the case of ECIL v. B. Karunakar [(1993) 4 SCC 727], this Court noticed the existing law and said that the theory of reasonable opportunity and the principles of natural justice have been evolved to uphold the rule of law and to assist the individual to vindicate his just rights. They are neither incantations to be invoked nor rites to be performed on all and sundry occasions. Whether, in fact, prejudice has been caused to the employee or not on account of denial of report to him, has to be considered on the facts and circumstances of each case. The Court has clarified even the stage to which the departmental proceedings ought to be reverted in the event the order of punishment is set aside for these reasons. 89. The well established canons controlling the field of bias in service jurisprudence can reasonably extended to the element of prejudice as well in such matters. Prejudice de facto should not be based on a mere apprehension or even on a reasonable suspicion. It is important that the element of prejudice should exist as a matter of fact or there should be such definite inference of likelihood of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179120961/ 24 Veena Estates P.Ltd vs Commissione Of Income Tax Mumbai ... on 11 January, 2024 prejudice flowing from such default, which relates statutory violations.

The question is as to whether an alleged defect in the notice issued to\nthe appellant under Section 271(1)(c) read with Section 274 of the Act, in regard to which the\nappellant had never raised an objection from 1 (2020) 117 taxmann.com 182 (Bom.) 11 January,\n2024 ITXA302_2002.DOC29-12-2023.DOC the very inception, that is since last 30 years (from 19\nAugust, 1993), can now be permitted to be raised, in the absence of any prejudice being caused to\nthe appellant - assessee.\n\n2. This appeal under section 260A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short \"I.T. Act\") is filed by the\nappellant/assessee, being aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 30 October, 2001 passed by\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179120961/                                                                1                    Veena Estates P.Ltd vs Commissione Of Income Tax Mumbai ... on 11 January, 2024\n\nthe Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (for short \"ITAT\") whereby the respondent/Revenue's appeal\nagainst the order passed by the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) (for short \"CIT(A)\") has\nbeen allowed. Earlier the CIT(A) by its order dated 05 February, 1996, as impugned before the\nTribunal, had set aside the penalty of Rs.33,34,096/- imposed on the appellant/assessee under\nsection 271(1)(c) of the I.T. Act.\n\n3. At the outset, we may observe that by an order dated 14 September, 2004, the present appeal\ncame to be admitted by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court on the following substantial question of\nlaw:\n\n      \"Whether the Tribunal erred on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in\n      law in reversing the order of the CIT(A) and confirming the penalty of Rs.33,34,096/-\n      (Rupees Thirty three lacs Thirty four thousand Ninety six only) levied by the\n       Assessing Officer under section 271(1)(c) of the Act?\n\n        11 January, 2024 ITXA302_2002.DOC29-12-2023.DOC\n\n4. The appeal was pending hearing, when before us, an oral application on behalf of the appellant\nwas made contending that the appeal stands covered by the decision rendered by a co-ordinate\nBench of this Court in Ventura Textile Ltd. (supra) and for such reason the appeal needs to be\nallowed. This Court at such stage considered the rival contentions of the parties including the\nsubmissions as advanced by learned amicus curiae, who was earlier appointed by a co-ordinate\nBench of this Court vide order dated 17 December, 2021, recording questions which would be\nrequired to be considered if the plea as urged on behalf of the appellant was to be accepted. The\nCourt, accordingly, passed the following order on 13 July, 2023:-\n\n         \"1. This appeal was circulated before us on behalf of the appellant contending that the\n       issue in regard to the alleged defect in the notice issued under Section 271(1)(c) of the\n      Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short, \"the Act\") would stand covered by the decision of a\n       co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Ventura Textiles Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income\n       Tax, Mumbai City-II, [2020] 117 taxmann.com 182 (Bombay).\n\n       2. We have perused the observations of the Court in such decision and more\n       particularly in paragraphs 20.1 and 20.2, whereby the Division Bench has observed\n       that even if a question was not raised before the tribunal, the same can be raised\n       before the High Court in the proceedings under Section 260-A of the Act, when the\n       issue is on jurisdiction. In our opinion, there cannot be any quarrel on such\n       proposition.\n\n        3. The question, however, would be whether an assessee can be permitted to raise a\n       technical plea of vagueness in the notice when the same was never the case of the\n       assessee before the tribunal. The assessee never complained that the notice under\n      Section 271(1)(c) of the Act was never understood by it or the same was in any\n      manner vague or defective and had caused any prejudice to the assessee. In fact, now\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179120961/                                                                2                    Veena Estates P.Ltd vs Commissione Of Income Tax Mumbai ... on 11 January, 2024\n\n      merely relying on the said decision, it is for the first time being contended that this\n     C o u r t s h o u l d  l a b e l  t h e n o t i c e  t o b e d e f e c t i v e 1 1 J a n u a r y , 2 0 2 4\n     ITXA302_2002.DOC29-12-2023.DOC in the proceedings of this appeal under\n       Section 260-A of the Act, in the absence of any such plea before the forums below. In\n      our prima facie opinion, the appellant needs to satisfy the Court whether the\n       appellant can at all urge such contention in the proceedings of a Section 260-A\n       appeal when admittedly such question of law is not raised in the present appeal.\n\n       4. In our opinion, in the facts of the present case, if the appellant intends an\n       additional question to be framed in this regard, the same cannot be done without the\n       appellant crossing the barrier of the test of specific prejudice, if any caused to it in\n       responding to such notice issued under Section 271(1)(c) of the Act, is satisfied.\n\n        5. The question therefore would be that when the assessee never raised a plea that the\n       assessee did not understand such notice issued to him and/ or acquiesced and\n      conceded in the adjudication of such notice, without any plea of prejudice being\n      taken at any point of time, then in such circumstances, can the assessee take a plea\n       before the High Court calling upon it to take a view that although no prejudice on\n      such count was earlier felt and suffered, merely because it is now technically noticed\n       that there was a defect in the notice by non striking of the applicable option, it should\n      be deemed to be presumed that a prejudice was caused to the assessee and therefore,\n      on such count, the penalty proceedings be declared illegal.\n\n        6. In our opinion, although Ventura Textiles Ltd. (supra) has though considered such\n       issue being raised as a jurisdictional question in the proceedings of 260-A of the\n      Income Tax Act, however, as to what would be the position as would be reflected\n      from the settled principles of law that there cannot be a plea of breach of principles of\n       natural justice, unless the threshold test of a \"factual prejudice\" being caused is\n        satisfied, for the Court to accept such plea, is not what has been expressly considered.\n\n        7. It was contended that the decision in Ventura Textiles Ltd. (supra) was also\n       considered by the Full Bench of this Court in Mohd.\n\nFarhan A. Shaikh v. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Central Circle1, Belgaum2. We have\nperused the judgment of the Full Bench and more particularly paragraphs 85 to 90 and paragraphs\n181 to 186, however, the issue which we have raised appears to have not been answered by the Full\nBench, is what we note.\n\n8. We would accordingly hear the parties on these issues on the adjourned date of hearing.\n\n9.

The most compendious statement known to me of the judicial process involved in assessing the credibility of an oral witness is to be found in the dissenting speech of Lord Pearce in the House of Lords in Onassis v Vergottis [1968] 2 Lloyds Rep 403 at p 431. In this, he touches on so many of the matters which I wish to mention that I may perhaps be forgiven for citing the relevant passage in full: ''Credibility' involves wider problems than mere 'demeanour' which is mostly concerned with whether the witness appears to be telling the truth as he now believes Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144944964/ 15 Reserved On: 21.11.2024 vs Rajesh Kumar Alias Raju on 29 November, 2024 it to be. Credibility covers the following problems. First, is the witness a truthful or untruthful person? Secondly, is he, though a truthful person telling something less than the truth on this issue, or though an untruthful person, telling the truth on this issue? Thirdly, though he is a truthful person telling the truth as he sees it, did he register the intentions of the conversation correctly and, if so has his memory correctly retained them? Also, has his recollection been subsequently altered by unconscious bias or wishful thinking or by over much discussion of it with others? Witnesses, especially those who 2024:HHC:12713-DB are emotional, and who think that they are morally in the right, tend very easily and unconsciously to conjure up a legal right that did not exist. It is a truism, often used in accident cases, that with every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active. For that reason, a witness, however honest, rarely persuades a Judge that his present recollection is preferable to that which was taken down in writing immediately after the accident occurred. Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance. And lastly, although the honest witness believes he heard or saw this or that, is it so improbable that it is on balance more likely that he was mistaken? On this point, it is essential that the balance of probability is put correctly into the scales in weighing the credibility of a witness. And motive is one aspect of probability. All these problems compendiously are entailed when a Judge assesses the credibility of a witness; they are all part of one judicial process. And in the process, contemporary documents and admitted or incontrovertible facts and probabilities must play their proper part.\" Every judge is familiar with cases in which the conflict between the accounts of different witnesses is so gross as to be inexplicable save on the basis that one or some of the witnesses are deliberately giving evidence which they know to be untrue . . .. more often dishonest evidence is likely to be prompted by the hope of gain, the desire to avert blame or criticism, or misplaced loyalty to one or other of the parties. The main tests needed to determine whether a witness is lying or not are, I think, the following, although their relative importance will vary widely from case to case: 2024:HHC:12713-DB (1) the consistency of the witness's evidence with what is agreed, or clearly shown by other evidence, to have occurred; (2) the internal consistency of the witness's evidence; (3) consistency with what the witness has said or deposed on other occasions; (4) the credit of the witness in relation to matters not germane to the litigation; (5) the demeanour of the witness. The first three of these tests may in general be regarded as giving a useful pointer to where the truth lies. If a witness's evidence conflicts with what is clearly shown to have occurred or is internally self- contradictory, or conflicts with what the witness has previously said, it may usually be regarded as Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144944964/ 16 Reserved On: 21.11.2024 vs Rajesh Kumar Alias Raju on 29 November, 2024 suspect. It may only be unreliable, and not dishonest, but the nature of the case may effectively rule out that possibility. The fourth test is perhaps more arguable. . . .\" 35. The following guidance of Lord Goff in Grace Shipping v. Sharp & Co [1987] 1 Lloyd's Law Rep. 207 at 215-6 is also helpful. \"And it is not to be forgotten that, in the present case, the Judge was faced with the task of assessing the evidence of witnesses about telephone conversations which had taken place over five years before. In such a case, memories may very well be unreliable; and it is of crucial importance for the Judge to have regard to the contemporary documents and the overall probabilities. In this connection, their Lordships wish to endorse a passage from a judgment of one of their number in Armagas Ltd v. Mundogas S.A. (The Ocean Frost), [1985] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 1, when he said at p. 57: - \"Speaking from my own experience, I have found it essential ...",

Briefly stated, the facts giving rise to the present appeal are that ASI Yoginder Singh (PW8), HC\nYashwant Singh, HC Manoj Kumar (PW6), Constable Anil Kumar, Constable Pawan Kumar and\nConstable Rajiv Kumar (PW7) left Shimla on 16.06.2011 towards Rohru, Jubbal etc for patrolling.\nThey were patrolling on Tiuni, Hatkoti road towards Tiuni on 16.06.2011 at about 4:30 PM at a\nlonely place when they saw the accused coming towards them. The accused returned after seeing the\npolice party and tried to throw away the bag (Ext.P3). The police apprehended him based on\nsuspicion. The police checked the bag and found black sticks (Ext.P4) inside the bag. ASI Yoginder\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144944964/                                                                1                         Reserved On: 21.11.2024 vs Rajesh Kumar Alias Raju on 29 November, 2024\n\nSingh (PW8) checked the sticks and found them to be charas. The place was lonely and deserted and\nno independent witness could be found despite efforts; hence, ASI Yoginder Singh (PW8) associated\nHC Yashwant Singh and HC Manoj Kumar (PW6) as witnesses. He enquired about the name and\naddress of the accused who revealed his name as Rajesh, resident of Uttrakhand. The police weighed\nthe charas with the help of a weighing scale and found its weight to be 3 kg 250 grams. The charas\nwas put in the bag. The bag was put in a cloth parcel (Ext.P2) and the parcel was sealed with seven\nimpressions of seal 'T'. ASI Yoginder Singh (PW8) searched the accused and found\n2024:HHC:12713-DB a purse (Ext.P7) containing currency notes worth €260/- (Ext.P8),\npassport-size photographs (Ext.P9) and a Nokia mobile (Ext.P6). These were put in another parcel\n(Ext.P5) and the parcel was sealed with five impressions of seal 'T'. NCB-1 Form (Ext.PW8/A) was\nfilled in triplicate. A seal impression was put on the Form. The sample seal (Ext.PW8/B) was taken\non a separate piece of cloth and the seal was handed over to HC Yashwant Singh after the use. The\nparcel was seized vide memo (Ext. PW6/A). Rukka (Ext.PW8/C) was prepared and handed over to\nConstable Rajiv Kumar (PW7) along with the case property with the directions to carry it to Police\nStation Jubbal. ASI Yoginder Singh (PW8) conducted the investigation. He prepared the site plan\n(Ext.PW8/D) and recorded the statements of witnesses as per their version. He arrested the accused\nvide memo (Ext.PW8/E). The case property and the rukka were produced before ASI Rikhi Ram\n(PW5) who was officiating as SHO at Police Station Jubbal. He got the FIR (Ext.PW4/A) registered\nbased on the rukka. He put the parcel containing charas in another parcel and sealed the outer\nparcel with three seals of seal impression 'R'. He filled the relevant columns of the NCB-1 Form and\nput the seal impression on the form. He issued a certificate (Ext.PW5/A). He obtained the seal\nimpression (Ext.PW5/B) on a 2024:HHC:12713-DB separate piece of cloth. He handed over the case\nproperty, sample seals and other documents to Head Constable Pyare Lal (PW4) who made an entry\nin the register No. 19 at Sl. No. 265 (Ext.PW4/B) and deposited the case property in Malkhana. He\nhanded over the parcel containing charas to Constable Jagdeep Singh (PW1) on 18.06.2011 along\nwith the documents, and sample seal with a direction to carry them to SFSL, Junga vide R.C. No.\n14/11 (Ext.PW4/C). Constable Jagdeep (PW1) deposited all the articles at SFSL, Junga and handed\nover the receipt to HC Piyare Lal (PW4). A special report (Ext.PW3/A) was prepared on 17.06.2011\nwhich was handed over to LC Babita (PW2) with the direction to carry it to SDPO Rohru. LC Babita\n(PW2) handed over the special report to Constable Kedar Singh (PW3) Assistant Reader to SDPO,\nRohru. He endorsed one copy and handed it over to LC Babita. He produced the second copy before\nSDPO, Rohru, who made the endorsement on the same. Constable Kedar Singh (PW3) made an\nentry in the register (Ext.PW3/A) and retained the special report on record. The result of analysis\n(Ext.PW5/C) was issued in which it was shown that the exhibit was an extract of cannabis and a\nsample of charas which contained 30.50 per cent w/w resin in it. The statements of the remaining\nwitnesses were recorded as per their version and 2024:HHC:12713-DB after the completion of the\ninvestigation the challan was prepared and presented before learned Sessions Judge Shimla, who\nassigned it to learned Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court), Shimla (learned Trial Court).\n\n3. The learned Trial Court charged the accused with the commission of an offence punishable under\nSection 20 of the ND&PS Act to which the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n4. The prosecution examined eight witnesses to prove its case. Constable Jagdeep Singh (PW1)\ncarried the case property to SFSL Junga. LC Babita (PW2) carried the special report to Dy.\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144944964/                                                                2                         Reserved On: 21.11.2024 vs Rajesh Kumar Alias Raju on 29 November, 2024\n\nSuperintendent of Police, Rohru. Constable Kedar Singh (PW3) was working as an Assistant Reader\nto SDPO Rohru. Head Constable Piyare Lal (PW4) was officiating as MHC with whom the case\nproperty was deposited. ASI Rikhi Ram (PW5) was officiating as SHO in Police Station, Jubbal who\nresealed the parcels and signed the FIR. HC Manoj (PW6) and Constable Rajiv Kumar (PW7) are the\nofficial witnesses to recovery. ASI Yoginder Singh (PW8) effected the recovery and conducted the\ninitial investigation.\n\n5. The accused in his statement recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. denied the prosecution case in\nits entirety. He stated 2024:HHC:12713-DB that he was innocent and police planted a false case\nupon him. He was taken to the Police Station from his house. He did not lead any defence evidence.\n\n6. The learned Trial Court held that the recovery was effected from the Bag and there was no\nrequirement to associate independent witnesses. However, the Court has to see the testimonies of\nofficial witnesses with due care and caution. There were many discrepancies in the statements of\nofficial witnesses. The incident had taken place near a heavily populated area and no independent\nwitness was associated. This made the prosecution case doubtful. The special report was handed\nover to Assistant Reader who claimed that he had produced it before SDPO Rohru. However, there\nis no endorsement regarding this fact in the special report and it was highly doubtful that the report\nwas produced before SDPO. The Investigating Officer had only prepared the NCB-1 Form and the\narrest memo. The witnesses were unable to tell who had prepared the other documents. All these\ncircumstances made the prosecution case highly suspect and it was difficult to rely upon the\nprosecution case. Consequently, the accused was acquitted.\n\n2024:HHC:12713-DB\n\n7. Being aggrieved from the judgment passed by the learned Trial Court, the State has filed the\npresent appeal asserting that the learned Trial Court failed to properly appreciate the material on\nrecord in its proper perspective. Learned Trial Court had set unrealistic standards to evaluate the\ndirect and cogent prosecution evidence. The reasoning of the learned Trial Court is unreasonable\nand unsustainable. The testimonies of official witnesses were discarded without any reason. There\nwas no evidence of any enmity between the police and the accused. Minor discrepancies do not\naffect the prosecution case and learned Trial Court erred in acquitting the accused based on minor\ndiscrepancies. A huge quantity of 3.250 kgs of charas was recovered from the accused. The accused\nwas found at a lonely and deserted place and it was not possible to associate any independent\nwitness.

This appeal arises from FIR No. 113/2017 which initially related to the alleged attempted murder of one Mr. Jagdish Kumar Gagneja by two unknown motorcyclists. who were on a motorcycle, by use of firearms around 8 pm on 6th August 2016. He was travelling with his wife in his 'Swift' car and had stopped at the road crossing behind the Jyoti Chowk Market, Jalandhar to attend nature's call when he was shot. He was stated to be the then Vice President of RSS for the State of Punjab and an active member of the said organization. 38. The said FIR was registered by PS Division Number 04 District Jalandhar, Punjab under Section 307, 34 IPC of 1860 read with 25, 27, 54, and 59 of the Arms Act 1956. 39. The attempt to kill the deceased Mr. Jagdish Kumar Gagneja was subsequently identified to be a part of a larger transnational conspiracy involving a series of eight incidents intended to destabilize the law and order situation in Punjab. Considering the gravity of the offence, this FIR was transferred to Central Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter 'CBI') on 7th September 2016 and was re-registered as RC-10(S)/2016/SCU.V/SC- II/CBI/New Delhi. The victim succumbed to the injuries on 20th September 2016. 40. Subsequently, this FIR was again transferred to the N.I.A on 8th March, 2019 and was re-registered as RC Number 07/2019/N.I.A/DLI. There are a total of twenty persons who are accused in this case. The Appellant is one of the accused. The Appellant was booked under Section 120-B of the IPC of 1860 and Sections 16 17, 18 of the Act. COMMON FACTS AS PER THE N.I.A REPORTS 41. The actual shooters in both the incidents were allegedly Hardeep Singh (1) and Ramandeep Singh (A-2) in both cases. The allegation is that they carried out a series of targeted killings during the period 2016-2017 in Ludhiana and Jalandhar Districts of Punjab. As per the reports of the N.I.A, the killing of the deceased by the masked youths is established by independent witnesses. On the basis of the investigation and the information received, A- 1- Hardeep Singh and A-2- Ramandeep Singh were both arrested on 21st December 2017. In their interrogation, it is claimed that they gave details of the eight incidents, in which they were involved. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185138927/ 20 Jagtar Singh Johal @ Jaggi vs National Investigation Agencey on 18 September, 2024 42. According to the N.I.A, the eight incidents in which they were involved were specifically for creating a law and order situation in Punjab. There was no previous animosity between the deceased victims and the shooters. The case of the N.I.A was that the accused persons are part of a conspiracy hatched by the Khalistan Liberation Force (hereinafter 'KLF') of which the Appellant is also a member. 43. As per the Reports one of the shooters A-1 - Hardeep Singh used to live with his paternal uncle (Tayaji) and his wife in Italy. A-3 - Harminder Singh @ Mintoo, one of the self-acclaimed leaders of Khalistan Liberation Force, had stayed as a guest in their house in Italy and during his interaction with Hardeep Singh, he started motivating him for committing violence in the name of Khalistan. It was during his stay there that he received 3000 GBP from the Appellant - Jagtar Singh Johal (A-6). It is claimed in the N.I.A's report that the Appellant is a close confidant of A-14-Harmeet Singh @ PhD and A-16-Gursharan Singh @ Gursharanveer and that the Appellant had delivered the said 3000 GBP to A-3-Harminder Singh on behalf of A-16. It is further alleged in the report that Appellant is a member of the KLF, who had complete knowledge of the conspiracy. The remaining portions of the report are not relevant for the present purposes. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT 44. The two main grounds urged on behalf of the Appellant are - a. That the Appellant has a limited role to play and b. Secondly that the Appellant has been incarcerated for a long period on unsubstantiated allegations. 45. Mr. Paramjeet Singh, ld.

Coming to the case on hand, I find that undisputedly, the petitioner herein is the registered owner of the vehicle, but she is not an accused in the subject FIR. It is Keshav Kumar, who was riding the motorcycle, is accused on account of recovery of 60 sachet of Smack from the pant which he was wearing. It is not the case of the prosecution that the contraband was concealed in any part of the vehicle. In such facts and circumstances, by no imagination, the vehicle could be held to have been used in transportation/conveyance of the contraband. 32. The word \"use\" which has come in Section 60(3) of the NDPS Act, cannot be given liberal or expansive meaning. It has to be interpreted strictly as it has penal consequences.

However, the same was rejected\n\n\n                 by learned Special Court, by the impugned order, holding as\n\n\n                 follows:-\n\n\n                                  \"From the records of the case, it appears that\n                       the Pulsor 150 CC motorcycle Regn. No. BR06BT-2837,\n                       Engine No. DHYRJD 26606 has been seized in\n                       connection with Ahiyapur P.S. Case no. 464/2021 dated\n                       16.07.2021\n\nU/s 414/34 of I.P.C. and U/s 8/20(b)(ii)(B) ND.P.S. Act.

From the report of D.TO. it appears that the motorcycle bearing\nregistration No. BR06BT-2837 has been registered in name of Sheelu Jha W/o Vijay Jha, having\nchasis No. MD2411CY9JRD01756, Engine No. DHYRJD266606. Same and similar report has also\nbeen submitted from the concerned P.S. By letter No. 2716 dated 14.09.2021. It has been\ncommunicated by the office of Collector, Muzaffarpur that proposal of forfeiture of aforesaid\nmotorcycle BR06BT-2837 has yet not received by him from S.S.P, Muzaffarpur/concerned P.S. It\nhas not been disclosed by the petitioner about the source of income by which the motorcycle in\nquestion has been purchased. It appears from the FIR that it was being used as conveyance in\ndealing with smack.\n\nConsidering the aforesaid facts, 1 am not inclined to release the motorcycle Regn. No. BR06BT-\n2837. Hence, petition dated 02.08.2021 preferred by Smt. Sheelu Jha stands rejected.\"\n\n4. I heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned APP for the State.\n\nSubmissions on behalf of the Petitioner\n\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is innocent and no way involved in\nthe alleged Patna High Court CR. REV. No.9 of 2022 dt.08-08-2025 offence. She is not even\naccused in the case. He further submits that in the alleged facts and circumstances, the vehicle in\nquestion could not be held to have been used in the commission of the alleged offence. The\ncontraband, 60 sachets of Smack, was recovered from the person of the accused Keshav Kumar i.e.\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109666198/                                                                3                            Smt.Sheelu Jha @ Sheelu Jha vs The State Of Bihar on 8 August, 2025\n\nfrom the pocket of the pant, the accused Keshav Kumar was wearing. It is not a case of the\nprosecution that the contraband was concealed in the Motorcycle. Hence, the Motorcycle could not\nbe held to have used in conveyance of the contraband. Hence, the vehicle was no way liable to be\nseized, let alone confiscation. He also submits that the petitioner is a bona fide owner of the vehicle\nand admittedly, she is registered owner of the vehicle.\n\n6. Hence, in view of learned counsel for the petitioner, the impugned order is not sustainable in the\neye of law. The petitioner is entitled to get interim custody of the vehicle during pendency of the trial\nbefore the Special Court.\n\nSubmissions on behalf of the State\n\n7. However, learned APP for the State defends the impugned order submitting that the vehicle in\nquestion has been seized for offence committed under the NDPS Act and under the NDPS Act, there\nis no provision for interim release of the Patna High Court CR. REV. No.9 of 2022 dt.08-08-2025\nvehicle and provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code regarding release of the vehicle to interim\ncustody of the owner of the vehicle not applicable.\n\n8. He also submits that the vehicle in question is also liable to confiscation and hence, it cannot be\nreleased to the petitioner, even if she is registered owner of the vehicle.\n\nConsideration\n\n9. I considered the submissions advanced by both the parties and perused the relevant materials on\nrecord.\n\n10. Before I proceed, it would be desirable to discuss the relevant law regarding seizure, confiscation\nand disposal of the vehicle involved in the commission of the offence under NDPS Act and\njurisdiction of the Special Court to release the vehicle to interim custody of the bonafide owner\nduring trial or inquiry.\n\nSeizure and Confiscation of Vehicles under the NDPS Act\n\n11. Section 60 of the NDPS Act deals with liability of illicit drugs, substances, plants, articles and\nconveyances to confiscation. Sub-Section-3 of Section 60 provides that any animal or conveyance\nused in carrying any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or any article liable to confiscation\nunder Sub-Section 1 or Sub-Section 2 shall be liable to Patna High Court CR. REV. No.9 of 2022\ndt.08-08-2025 confiscation unless the owner of the animal or conveyance proves that it was so used\nwithout the knowledge or connivance of the owner himself, his agent, if any and the\nperson-in-charge of the animal or conveyance and that each of them had taken all reasonable\nprecautions against such use. In other words, if the owner of the vehicle/conveyance proves that his\nvehicle was used in the commission of the offence without his knowledge or connivance and he ha...",

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184353298/ 20 Jagtar Singh Johal @ Jaggi vs National Investigation Agency on 18 September, 2024 42. According to the N.I.A, the eight incidents in which they were involved were specifically for creating a law and order situation in Punjab. There was no previous animosity between the deceased victims and the shooters. The case of the N.I.A was that the accused persons are part of a conspiracy hatched by the Khalistan Liberation Force (hereinafter 'KLF') of which the Appellant is also a member. 43. As per the Reports one of the shooters A-1 - Hardeep Singh used to live with his paternal uncle (Tayaji) and his wife in Italy. A-3 - Harminder Singh @ Mintoo, one of the self-acclaimed leaders of Khalistan Liberation Force, had stayed as a guest in their house in Italy and during his interaction with Hardeep Singh, he started motivating him for committing violence in the name of Khalistan. It was during his stay there that he received 3000 GBP from the Appellant - Jagtar Singh Johal (A-6). It is claimed in the N.I.A's report that the Appellant is a close confidant of A-14-Harmeet Singh @ PhD and A-16-Gursharan Singh @ Gursharanveer and that the Appellant had delivered the said 3000 GBP to A-3-Harminder Singh on behalf of A-16.

Facts, in brief, germane are as follows:-\n\n      Accused No.1/petitioner No.1 is the husband; accused No.2, mother in law; accused\n       No.3, father-in-law; accused NC: 2024:KHC:36345 No.4, grandmother and accused\n       No.5, brother-in-law of the complainant. It is the averment in the petition that when\n       the 1st petitioner was working with Virgin Coffee Private Limited during the year\n      2019, the 2nd respondent had contacted him in connection with business\n       transactions/sale of coffee. Since then, it is the claim of the complainant, that she\n       dealt with agro-products such as spices and coffee and had a company named\n      Deepika Enterprises.\n\n3. The story fast forwards to three years. On 28-08-2022, it appears that the 1st petitioner meets the\ncomplainant for the first time in Hotel Lalit Mahal Palace, Mysore in connection with a business\ntransaction. It is then, the relationship of the 1st petitioner with the complainant blooms. On\n08-09-2022, the 2nd respondent registers a complaint alleging offences punishable under Section\n376 of the IPC barely after 15 days of the aforesaid meeting and blooming of the relationship. On\n19-09-2022, it appears that the 2nd respondent registers another complaint where it is alleged that\nthe 1st petitioner married her by appearing before the Sub- Registrar at Sakleshapur; the alleged\nincident had taken place on 15-09-2022 and she was abandoned in the intervening NC:\n2024:KHC:36345 period. The impugned crime comes to be registered on 22-09-2022 before the\nKushalnagar Town Police Station for the offences afore-quoted. The registration of crime has driven\nthe petitioners to this Court in the subject petition.\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/17389837/                                                                 3                                        Sri Viveka P K vs The State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2024\n\n4. Heard Sri Murthy D.Naik, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners and Sri B.N.\nJagadeesha, learned Additional Special Public Prosecutor for respondent No.1. The 2nd respondent\nwho appears in person has been absent continuously. This Court noting her absence, on 05-03-2024\nlisted the matter on 21-03-2024. Again on 21-03-2024, the matter was adjourned. On 28-08-2024,\nthis Court heard the learned senior counsel for the petitioners and recorded his submissions. As a\nlast chance, the matter was adjourned to 31-08-2024. On 31-08-2024, again there was no\nrepresentation of the 2nd respondent. The matter was directed to be listed on 03-09-2024. Even on\n03-09-2024, there was no representation of the 2nd respondent. Therefore, the learned senior\ncounsel for the petitioners and the learned Additional State Public Prosecutor were heard and all\navailable materials on record are perused.\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:36345\n\n5. The learned senior counsel for the petitioners would project gross abuse of the process of law by\nthe 2nd respondent in registering crime after crime against different men. It is his submission that if\nit is viewed in a proper perspective, the 1st petitioner would be the victim of 10th crime registered by\nthe complainant. He would submit that all documents are placed on record depicting crimes so\nregistered by the 2nd respondent against several other persons including the 1st petitioner for\noffences punishable under Section 498A of the IPC that is now alleged. The learned senior counsel\nwould submit that there is not even a speck of ingredient of the offences and the complainant has\ndragged in all the members of the family including the sister of the mother in-law into the web of\ncrime. Therefore, he would submit that if further proceedings are permitted to be continued, there\ncan be no better illustration of any proceeding becoming an abuse of the process of law.\n\n6. The learned Additional Special Public Prosecutor Sri B.N.Jagadeesha, would also on verification\nof the record of investigation that has taken place for sometime, submits that the documents that are\nproduced by the learned senior counsel NC: 2024:KHC:36345 for the petitioners are all of a matter\nof record and investigation also reveals the same facts.\n\n7. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the respective learned counsel\nand have perused the material on record.\n\n8. The narration of the 1st petitioner meeting the complainant is what is averred in the petition. It is\nsaid that the 1st petitioner after meeting the complainant in the year 2019 meets her in 2022 in\nconnection with business transaction or future business expansion. Therefore, the friendship\nbetween the 1st petitioner and the complainant began to bloom initially over phone and later flowers\ninto a relationship. Thereafter, it is the averment again that the complainant used to call the 1st\npetitioner on his mobile and talk for sometime intermittently. On 28-08-2022, it is the averment\nthat the 1st petitioner has met the complainant for the first time and the issue b...",

This appeal arises from FIR No. 113/2017 which initially related to the alleged attempted murder of one Mr. Jagdish Kumar Gagneja by two unknown motorcyclists. who were on a motorcycle, by use of firearms around 8 pm on 6th August 2016. He was travelling with his wife in his 'Swift' car and had stopped at the road crossing behind the Jyoti Chowk Market, Jalandhar to attend nature's call when he was shot.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12736680/ 20 Jagtar Singh Johal @ Jaggi vs Ational Investigation Agency on 18 September, 2024 42. According to the N.I.A, the eight incidents in which they were involved were specifically for creating a law and order situation in Punjab. There was no previous animosity between the deceased victims and the shooters. The case of the N.I.A was that the accused persons are part of a conspiracy hatched by the Khalistan Liberation Force (hereinafter 'KLF') of which the Appellant is also a member. 43. As per the Reports one of the shooters A-1 - Hardeep Singh used to live with his paternal uncle (Tayaji) and his wife in Italy. A-3 - Harminder Singh @ Mintoo, one of the self-acclaimed leaders of Khalistan Liberation Force, had stayed as a guest in their house in Italy and during his interaction with Hardeep Singh, he started motivating him for committing violence in the name of Khalistan. It was during his stay there that he received 3000 GBP from the Appellant - Jagtar Singh Johal (A-6). It is claimed in the N.I.A's report that the Appellant is a close confidant of A-14-Harmeet Singh @ PhD and A-16-Gursharan Singh @ Gursharanveer and that the Appellant had delivered the said 3000 GBP to A-3-Harminder Singh on behalf of A-16. It is further alleged in the report that Appellant is a member of the KLF, who had complete knowledge of the conspiracy.

Thru Lok Aaukta,Jbp on 20 March, 2010\n\n\n\n\n       Per Rakesh Saksena, J.\n\nAppellant has filed this appeal against the judgment dated 23th July, 2000 passed by Special\nJudge/Ist Additional Sessions Judge, Jabalpur in Special Criminal Case No.3/1995 convicting him\nunder section 409 of the Indian Penal Code and section 5(1)(c) read with section 5(2) of the\nPrevention of Corruption Act,1947/section 13(1)(c) read with section 13(2) of the Prevention of\nCorruption Act, 1988 and sentencing him to rigorous imprisonment for 2 years with fine of\nRs.10,000/- and rigorous imprisonment for 2 years with fine of Rs.10,000/- on each count\nrespectively. Both the sentences have been directed to run concurrently.\n\n2. According to prosecution, on 14.2.1983 and before, appellant was posted as Sub-Engineer in\nReceipt Sub-division of Rani Awanti Bai, Sagar Project. In discharge of his duties as a public\nservant, he dishonestly misappropriated the property of the store worth Rs.34,762.69 and obtained\npecuniary advantage, thus, committed criminal breach of trust and criminal misconduct punishable\nunder section 409 I.P.C. and section 5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.\n\n3. It is not disputed that appellant remained posted as Sub- Engineer in Receipt Sub-division of the\nstore of Awanti Bai Sagar Project, Bargi Nagar Jabalpur between the year 1979 and 28.3.83.\n\n4. Prosecution case in brief is that Hanumant Singh, Inspector of Special Police Establishment\nDivision, Jabalpur, under the orders of Superintendent of Police, checked the stock of Central store\nof Bargi Dam Project with the help of technical assistants viz. Ajit Lal and Dilip Kumar Ghosh\nbetween 14.2.83 to 20.2.83 in presence of appellant S.K.Batham, incharge of Receipt Sub-division.\nOn checking, various articles worth Rs.34,672.69 were found short and at the same time goods\nworth Rs.13,220.24 was found surplus. According to prosecution, this indicated that most of the\ntransactions of issue and receipts of the store were false and fraudulent. After checking the balance\nand after physical verification of articles, inspecting team prepared index Ex.P/1 as follows:\n\n         --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n       S.No.     Articles                  Balance           Number of articles\n                                                            found after physical              s\n                                                                verification.\n\n         -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n         1.

During investigation, various registers, forms, indents, account registers, contract files, supply\nfiles and other documents were seized. On further investigation by Inspector S.K.Mishra, again a list\nof short and surplus articles in the store was prepared. On completion of the investigation and after\nobtaining the sanction, charge sheet against the appellant was filed.\n\n6. Appellant abjured his guilt and pleaded false implication. According to him, he had obtained\ncharge from Sub-Engineer Shri S.K.Dubey. Though Executive Engineer directed him to take charge\nof late Shri Thomas, but none handed over him the charge and, therefore, without taking formal\ncharge, in compliance of the order of Executive Engineer he started his work. He denied that any\nmeasurement or raid was done before him and any shortage was found in the stock.\n\n7. To substantiate prosecution case, ten prosecution witnesses were examined and number of\ndocuments were exhibited. Learned Special Judge, after trial and upon appreciation of the evidence\nadduced in the case, held the appellant guilty and convicted him under section 409 I.P.C. and\nsection 5(1)(c) read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act,1947/section 13(1)\n\n(c) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/493882/                                                                   3                          S.K.Batham vs The State Of M.P. Thru Lok Aaukta,Jbp on 20 March, 2010\n\n8. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the evidence and material on\nrecord.\n\n9. It is no longer disputed that the appellant was a public servant and was posted as Sub-Engineer in\nStore Sub-division of Bargi Dam Project. D.C.Bisen (PW3), who was posted as Steno in the office of\nSuperintending Engineer in the said Project, stated that he was directed to produce the papers in\nrespect of the charge of Sub- Engineers S.K.Dubey and S.K.Batham. He produced the letters and\ncorrespondence in that regard which were Ex.P/8 to P/13. He also proved letter Ex.P/14, signed by\nthe Executive Engineer. On perusal of letter Ex.P/14, it is revealed that on 23.6.1982 appellant was\nasked to take over charge of the stock items handled by late Shri P.V.Thomas Sub-Engineer.\nS.K.Dubey (PW2), who was posted as Sub-Engineer, stated that when he was transferred to store\ndivision, appellant was working in his department. Since he was dealing the cases of cement, on his\ntransfer to other division, he handed over the charge of some articles to appellant. According to him,\nSub-Engineer Thomas was posted in Receipt section of the Sub-division. After his death, in the same\nsection appellant was posted. The evidence of aforesaid witnesses stood corroborated by the\nevidence of Purushottam Dubey (PW8) who was posted as supervisor in the Receipt Sub-division of\nthe store. He categorically stated that appellant was posted as Sub-Engineer and the receipt charge\nof the store was with him. It is thus evident that on 14.2.1983 appellant was a public servant and was\nposted as incharge of the Receipt Sub- division of the store of Bargi Project.\n\n10. According to Dilip Kumar Ghosh (PW1), he was posted as a technical assistant in Lokayukta\noffice Bhopal. On the orders of his department in the year 1983 he had conducted checking of the\nstore of Bargi Project. He had found shortage of property in the store whereas some articles in the\nstore were found surplus. At the time of checking, appellant had been incharge of the store. He had\nprepared the list of property (Ex.P/1) recording the balance of shortage and excess of the goods\nfound in the store. He stated that at the time of verification, appellant, Inspector Hanumant Singh\nand his staff was also present. Balance list Ex.P/1 was signed by both of them.

The ratio of the judgment that FIR No. 17 dated 28.3.2003 was registered under Sections 379 & 406 IPC, whereas in the present FIR No. 27 dated 21.5.2003, in which the petitioner had been arrayed as an accused under Section 420, 409, 406, 467, 468, 471, 465, 120-B IPC and 13(1)(c)(d) read with 13(2) Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 registered at Police Station Vigilance Bureau, Ludhiana, District Ludhiana, for his active participation for preparing the forged document and fraudulently attaching the jamabandi shows his connivance. In the case of Babubhai vs. State of Gujarat & others (supra) Hon'ble the Supreme Court has held that two FIRs in respect of same occurrence are permissible. The relevant part of the judgment reads as under :- \"Criminal Procedure Code, Sectioni 154- Counter claim- Two F.I.Rs in respect of same occurrence whether permissible (yes) - Held :- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145218645/ 6 Baljeet Singh vs State Of Punjab & Another on 16 May, 2011 Crl. Misc. No. M-27843 of 2010 (1) Filing an FIR pertaining to a counter claim in respect of the same incident having a different version of events, is permissible. (2) In case the FIRs are not in respect of the same cognizable offence of the same occurrence giving rise to one or more cognizable offences nor are they alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction or the same occurrence as the one alleged in the First FIR, there is no prohibition in accepting the second FIR. 2006(1) RCR (Crl.) 675 : 2006(1) Apex Criminal 224, 2009(1) RCR (Crl.) 3 : 2008(6) RAJ 555. 14. In Upkar Singh Vs. Ved Prakash & Ors. (2004) 13 SCC 292, this Court considered the judgment in T.T. Antony (supra) and explained that the judgment in the said case does not exclude the registration of a complaint in the nature of counter claim from the purview of the court. What had been laid down by this Court in the aforesaid case is that any further complaint by the same complainant against the same accused, subsequent to the registration of a case, is prohibited under the Cr.P.C. because an investigation in this regard would have already started and further the complaint against the same accused will amount to an improvement on the facts mentioned in the original complaint, hence, will be prohibited under section 162 Cr.P.C. However, this rule will not apply to a counter Crl. Misc. No. M-27843 of 2010 claim by the accused in the first complaint or on his behalf alleging a different version of the said incident. Thus,in case, there are rival versions in respect of the same episode, the Investigating Agency would take the same on two different FIRs and investigation can be carried under both of them by the same investigating agency and thus, filing an FIR pertaining to a counter claim in respect of the same incident having a different version of events, is permissible. 15. In Rameshchandra Nandlal Parikh v. State of Gujarat & Anr. 2006(1) R.C.R. (Criminal) 675 :2006(1) Apex Criminal 224; (2006)1 SCC 732, this Court reconsidered the earlier judgment including T.T.

In the year 2000, he was Crl. Misc. No. M-27843 of 2010 promoted as\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145218645/                                                                1                                       Baljeet Singh vs State Of Punjab & Another on 16 May, 2011\n\n        District Development and Panchayat Officer. Grievance of the petitioner is that he\n      has been named in the FIR registered by the Vigilance Bureau, Ludhiana, as one of\n       the alleged accused persons. An FIR No. 17 dated 28.3.2003 under Sections 379 &\n     406 IPC already stood registered at police station Machhiwara with regard to the\n      same subject matter.\n\n      The petitioner was posted as BDPO Machhiwara on 14.7.1997 and as such was in\n       charge of almost 102 Gram Panchayats falling under the said Block. Gram Panchayat\n      Mannewal vide resolution dated 30.5.2000 decided to auction 381 Kanals 14 Marlas\n       of the land belonging to the Gram Panchayat on lease, whereafter a public auction\n      was announced on 7.6.2000. This auction was postponed to 15.6.2000 due to lack of\n       sufficient number of Auction Purchasers. The auction was further postponed to\n       19.7.2000 due to the same reason. On 4.8.2000, the land was auctioned in favour of\n       three persons namely Amandeep Singh, Madan Singh and Paprgat Singh for a period\n       of 7 years. The land was 'Banjar Qadim', therefore, as per the terms & conditions of\n       the auction the lessees were to properly level the land and make it fit for cultivation.\n      The land leased out for seven years for this purpose, was permissible under the Rules.\n      The auction was carried out under the supervision of the Administrator and was\n      approved by the petitioner.\n\nFurther it was submitted that auction so held was further submitted for approval to the then DDPO\nSh. Bhajan Singh, who granted the approval on the same day. After completing the formalities, the\nlessees took possession of the land.\n\nCrl. Misc. No. M-27843 of 2010 The lessee carried out levelling of the land and no complaint was\nreceived by the petitioner from any quarter till 9.4.2001 when the petitioner was transferred from\nMachhiwara to Block Ludhiana-II. The first complaint with regard to the lessees violating the terms\n& conditions of the auction was received in the office of BDPO in July 2002. As per the complaint,\nthere was illegal lifting of sand from the Panchayat land by the lessees which was in complete\nviolation of the terms and conditions of the auction. Thereafter various other complaints were also\nmade to DSP Police, Samrala on 29.8.2002 and vide letter No. 731 dated 17.12.2002 even the DDPO,\nLudhiana informed the Deputy Commissioner, Ludhiana about the said illegal lifting of sand. The\nofficials of Police Station, Machhiwara lodged an FIR No. 17 dated 28.3.2003 under Sections 379,\n406 IPC against the accused. The petitioner was not named as an accused in the aforementioned\nFIR. Before lodging of the FIR on 11.3.2003, the DDPO, Ludhiana exercising his powers under the\nAct cancelled the auction held on 4.8.2000. The lessees challenged the said order before the learned\nCommissioner, who stayed the order of the DDPO. On 8.8.2002, one of the lessees namely\nAmandeep Singh also filed a suit for injunction against the Gram Panchayat and the Secretary. Vide\norder dated 18.11.2002, Court of learned Addl. Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Ludhiana restrained the\nGram Panchayat from interfering in the activities of the petitioner Amandeep Singh from removing\nthe sand for levelling the land for cultivation.\n\nFIR No. 27 dated 21.5.2003 under Section 420, 409, 406, 467, 468, 471, 465, 120-B IPC and\n13(1)(c)(d) read with 13(2) Crl.

In this F.I.R, the estimated monetary loss was assessed at Rs. 3 crore. The\nperiod of alleged complaint of illegal sand mining was fixed from the year 2000 to 2003. It is alleged\nthat the petitioner has committed the offence while working as BDPO in the year 2000.\n\nSupplementary challan, which has been submitted against the petitioner, the Vigilance Bureau has\ninducted two Patwaris on the allegation that the said Patwaris had shown the land in dispute to be\ncultivable and the lessee getting wheat and paddy crop from the year 2000 to 2004 and as such both\nthe Patwaries also connived with the accused. The allegation in the FIR is that the illegal sand lifting\nis being done and the land has been dug up for almost 15 feet deep. The lessee can not be getting\nwheat and paddy crop from the year 2000 to 2004. It is alleged that only petitioner has been\nincluded as accused, whereas after he had been transferred in the year 2001. The other BDPOs, who\njoined after transfer of the petitioner in April 2001 till 2003 have been left out. As per the FIR\nregistered by the DSP, Vigilance sand mining continued unabated from the year 2000 till 2003 and\nthe loss for the total 3 years is pegged at Rs. 3 crores.\n\nDuring the pendency of this Criminal Miscellaneous vide order dated 30.9.2010 (Annexure P-8)\ncharge has been framed against the petitioner by the learned Special Judge, Ludhiana. As per this\norder, Gurnam Singh Sarpanch (accused No.1) in connivance Crl. Misc. No. M-27843 of 2010 with\naccused Harcharan Singh Marwaha have sold sand amounting to crore in rupees and have caused\nloss to the Government in crorers. They have also embezzled the grants of the village. They have\nprepared forged documents and in this way they have committed an offence under Sections 420,\n409, 406, 467, 468, 471, 465, 120-B IPC and 13(1)(c)(d) read with 13(2) Prevention of Corruption\nAct, 1988. the charges were framed against 28 accused, which includes Gurnam Singh Sarpanch,\nMohinder Singh, Member Panchayat, Devinder Singh, Panchayat Secretary, Sucha Singh, Kuldip\nSingh and Chaman Lal, Contractors of Gurnam Mineral. Baljit Singh, present petitioner / accused\nNo.21 against whom charges have been framed. The charge-sheet Annexure P-9 is dated 8.10.2010.\n\nMr. Gill learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the challan presented against the\npetitioner in FIR No. 27 dated 21.5.2003 under Section 420, 409, 406, 467, 468, 471, 465, 120-B\nIPC and 13(1)(c)(d) read with 13(2) Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 registered at Police Station\nVigilance Bureau, Ludhiana, District Ludhiana is liable to be quashed on the ground that this is a\nsecond FIR arising out of the same incident. He has placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in the case of T.T. Antony vs. State of Kerala 2001(3) R.C.R. (Criminal) 436 and\nBabubhai vs. State of Gujarat & others 2010(5) R.A.J. 267.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2001(3) RCR Criminal 436 in the case of T.T. Antony vs. State of Kerala had\nconsidered the case in which the F.I.R had been registered under Section 154 sub Crl. Misc. No.\nM-27843 of 2010 clause (i). More than one information was given to the police in respect of the\nsame incident. The information received during investigation will fall under Section 162 Cr.P.C. The\nsecond F.I.R cannot be registered on receipt of subsequent information. In the case before Supreme\nCourt, the F.I.R had been registered under Section 307 IPC. During investigation, the victim died.\nSecond F.I.R was not required to be registered under Section 302 IPC. In para 20 and 21, the\nSupreme Court had observed as under:-\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145218645/                                                                3                                       Baljeet Singh vs State Of Punjab & Another on 16 May, 2011\n\n       20. The scheme of the Cr.P.C. is that an officer in charge of a Police Station has to\n     commence investigation as provided in Section 156 or 157 of Cr.P.C. on the basis of\n       entry of the First Information Report, on coming to know of the commission of a\n       cognizable offence.

Case No.75 of 1994. By the said order, the learned Addl.Sessions Judge has refused to add\ncharges under Sections 3,4 and 5 of the Explosive Substances Act,1908.\n\n2. Short fact of the case is that on the basis of fardbeyan of this petitioner, a case vide Arrah Nawada\nP.S. Case No.75 of 1994 was registered on 8.5.1994 for the offences punishable under Sections\n452,324,307 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 and 4 of the Explosive Substance Act. In the\nF.I.R., the petitioner alleged that on 8.5.1994 in the morning at about 8.00 A.M. unknown accused\npersons entered into the house of the petitioner and exploded bomb and three persons of the\ninformant side were assaulted and offence of attempt of Opp.Party no.2 to murder had also taken\nplace. After registering the case police investigated the same and during the investigation the police\nfound that Opp.Party nos.2 to 10 were involved in the occurrence and after obtaining sanction from\nthe District Magistrate, Arrah for prosecuting the accused persons for offences under Sections 3,4\nand 5 of the Explosive Substances Act submitted chargesheet against Opp.Party nos. 2 to 10 for the\noffences under Sections 452,324,307,120B of the Indian Penal Code and 3,4 and 5 of the Explosive\nSubstance Act. In this case chargesheet was submitted on 5.9.1994, the date on which sanction was\nobtained.\n\n3. After submission of the chargesheet on 19.9.1994, the learned Magistrate took cognizance of\noffences under Section 452,324,307,120B of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3,4 and 5 of the\nExplosive Substances Act. After completion of appearance and supply of police papers, the case was\ncommitted to the Court of Sessions and in the case charges were framed on 1.6.1998. At the time of\ncharge since sanction for prosecution under Sections 3,4 and 5 of the Explosive Substances Act was\nnot available on the record, charges could not be framed for the offences under Sections 3,4 and 5 of\nthe Explosive Substances Act. However, charges were framed against all the accused for the offences\nunder Sections 452,324,307 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. Subsequently, on 31.10.1998 a\npetition was filed on behalf of the prosecution for adding charges under Sections 3,4 and 5 of the\nExplosive Substances Act. Subsequent to filing of the petition by the prosecution, this petitioner\nbeing the informant on 7.11.1998 also filed similar petition. The defence filed rejoinder to the\npetition filed by the prosecution. The rejoinder was filed on 21.11.1998 and thereafter the matter was\nheard at length by the learned 9th Addl.Sessions Judge, Arrah.\n\n4. During the hearing of petition dated 31.10.1998 filed by the prosecution for adding the charge for\noffences under Sections 3,4 and 5 of the Explosive Substances Act , a plea was taken on behalf of the\ndefence that the District Magistrate, who had accorded sanction for prosecution under Sections 3,4\nand 5 of the Explosive Substance Act, was not at all competent to accord sanction under Section 7 of\nthe Explosive Substance Act. On behalf of the defence, a case law was cited, i.e. 1993 (1) PLJR 235,\nJagat Narayan Upadhaya Vs. State of Bihar. The learned Sessions Judge after noticing observation\nof this Court recorded in Jagat Narayan Upadhaya's case ( supra) held that no contrary ruling was\nplace by the prosecution and, accordingly, the learned Sessions Judge held that the sanction filed in\nthe case was not valid sanction in the eye of law and, accordingly, the learned Addl.Sessions Judge\nby its order dated 25.2.1999 rejected the petition for adding charges under Sections 3,4 and 5 of the\nExplosive Substances Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171331003/                                                                2                                 Tarkeshwar Singh vs State Of Bihar & Ors on 24 June, 2010\n\n5. Aggrieved with the order dated 25.2.1999, the petitioner, who was the informant of the case,\napproached this Court by filing the present petition.\n\n6. Sri Akhileshwar Prasad Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, while\nchallenging the order dated 25.2.1999 passed by the learned Addl.Sessions Judge, submits that\nwhile dismissing the petition, the learned Addl.Sessions Judge had incorrectly appreciated the case\nlaw , which was cited on behalf of the defence. During the course of hearing, Sri Akhileshwar\nPd.Singh has produced a photo copy of the Notification No.S.O. 3583 dated 2nd December, 1978\nissued by the Government of India. Let it be kept on record. While relying on this Notification,\nlearned counsel for the petitioner submits that the sanction order, which is Annexure-2 to the\npetition, was issued in accordance with the provisions contained in Section 7 of the Explosive\nSubstance Act and according to him, learned Addl.Sessions Judge without minutely examining the\nsanction order has incorrectly held that the District Magistrate was not competent to accord\nsanction. The Sanction order, which is Annexure-2 to the petition, contains the averment that the\nDistrict Magistrate was authorized by the Government of India in view of Notification contained in\nS.O.No.3583 dated 2nd December, 1978.\n\n7. Sri Akhileshwar Pd. Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner further argued that the learned Addl.\nSessions Judge, while rejecting the prayer to add charge under Sections 3,4 and 5 of the Explosive\nSubstances Act, has heavily relied upon the judgment of this Court passed in Jagat Narayan\nUpadhaya's case (Supra). He submits that the fact of Jagat Narayan Upadhaya's case(Supra) was\nentirely different from the fact of the present case. In Jagat Narayan Upadhaya's case ( Supra), the\npetition was filed after the order of cognizance and it was argued that the District Magistrate was not\ncompetent for according sanction of the prosecution. The learned court below incorrectly has taken\ncognizance of the offences. The said case was rejected on the ground that the same was premature.\nSo far as the present case is concerned, it was submitted that in this case , prosecution sanction was\ngranted by the District Magistrate in accordance with authorization given by the Central\nGovernment with the consent of the State Government in view of notification dated 2.12.1978.\nAccordingly, it was argued that the learned Sessions Judge has incorrectly appreciated the\nJudgment passed in Jagat Narayan Upadhaya's case ( Supra) .\n\n8. Sri Akhileshwar Pd.

Shri Adil Minhaj counsel for the applicant ^ Shri Avinash K Mishra Panel Lawyer for the State\nCORAM: Single Bench Honble Shri Manindra Mohan Shrivastava J Dated: 16/11/2010 : Judgement\nORAL ORDER (Passed on 16th of November, 2010) Criminal Revision under Section 53 of the\nJuvenine Justice Care and Protection of Children Act 2000 With the consent of learned counsel for\nthe parties, the matter is heard finally.\n\n2. This criminal revision under Section 53 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children)\nAct, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") is directed against order dated 06-05-2010 passed by\nthe Sessions Judge, Raipur in Criminal Appeal No.35 of 2010 whereby order dated 21- 04-2010\npassed by the Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board, Mana Camp, Raipur, rejecting\npetitioner's application under Section 12 of the Act has been confirmed.\n\n3. Assailing the correctness and validity of the order dated 21-04-2010 passed by the Juvenile\nJustice Board and the order passed in appeal by the appellate Court, learned counsel for the\napplicant contended that the rejection of application for grant of bail is wholly illegal. Learned\ncounsel for the applicant argued that in view of the provisions of Section 12 of the Act, in case of\nalleged commission of offence by a Juvenile, ordinarily, bail has to be granted and the statutory\nmandate not to release will operate only when there appear reasonable grounds for believing that\nthe release is likely to bring him into association with any known criminal or expose him to moral,\nphysical or psychological danger or that his release would defeat the ends of justice.\n\nReferring to the provisions contained in Section 12 of the Act, learned counsel for the applicant\nargued that the Juvenile Justice Board rejected the application without there being any material or\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88366379/                                                                 1                             Dayasagar Yadav vs State Of Chhattisgarh on 16 November, 2010\n\ncircumstances justifying conclusion that release would defeat the ends of justice. Further\nsubmission is that none of the grounds justifying rejection of the application were made out yet by\ntaking into consideration extraneous aspect with regard to the nature and gravity of offence, which\nis ordinarily relevant while considering applications for grant of bail under Section 439 of the\nCr.P.C., application of the applicant has been rejected by the Juvenile Justice Board in the present\ncase. In order to buttress his submission, learned counsel for the applicant relied upon the decision\nof this Court Bharat @ Bhrat & Another vs. State of C.G., 2006 (1) C.G.L.J. 72, Akhilesh Kumar vs.\nState of C.G., 2006 (1) C.G.L.J. 305 and Rahul Mishra v. State of M.P., 2001 Cr.L.J.\n\n214.\n\n4. On the other hand, learned State counsel submitted that while rejecting applicant's application\nunder Section 12 of the Act, no illegality has been committed by the Juvenile Justice Board, as the\nCourt below has considered only relevant considerations in order to form an opinion against release\nof the applicant that such release would defeat the ends of justice. Further submission of learned\nState counsel is that the learned lower appellate Court has also considered this aspect and taking\ninto consideration the overall circumstances of the case, has recorded that release of the applicant\nwould bring him into association with any known criminal and also expose him to moral, physical or\npsychological danger. Learned State counsel argued that the circumstances in which the offences is\nalleged to have been committed itself show that the Juvenile was not living in a healthy company,\nand therefore, if he is allowed to be released, it would not be in his interest for the reasons stated in\nthe order passed by the Board as well as by the appellate Court.\n\n5. The Board vide its order dated 21-04-2010 rejected application of the applicant by recording that\nin the event of release, the ends of justice are likely to be defeated. No specific reason has been\nassigned by the Board to come to the said conclusion. However, from a reading of the order and the\ncontents thereof preceding such a conclusion, it is revealed that the Court has taken into\nconsideration that the applicant is charged of commission of offence under Section 302 of the I.P.C.\ncausing death of owner of Dhabha by assaulting with a club. The order further records that\nconsidering the nature of offence; release would defeat the ends of justice. From the aforesaid\nreading of the order, it is clear that the Board arrived at the conclusion that the release would defeat\nthe ends of justice only on the basis of the nature of offence.\n\nThe learned appellate Court has recorded that the offence of murder is a serious offence. The finding\nrecorded by the appellate Court that release would bring him into association with any known\ncriminal or expose him to moral, physical or psychological danger is again not based on any other\ncircumstance except that the offence is of grave nature.\n\nFrom the order passed by the Board as well as by the appellate authority, it is thus discernable that\nwhile the Board rejected the application of the applicant only on the ground that it would defeat the\nends of justice in view of the nature of offence, the appellate Court has confirmed the order by\nrecording a finding of exposures by psychological danger on the basis of gravity of offence. There is\nno other circumstance or ground considered by the Courts below to come to such conclusion and\nreject the application.\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88366379/                                                                 2                             Dayasagar Yadav vs State Of Chhattisgarh on 16 November, 2010\n\n6. The scope and object of provision regarding grant of bail to a Juvenile as envisaged under Section\n12 of the Act came up for consideration before the Single Judge of this Court in the case of Bharat @\nBhrat & Another (supra), wherein it was held that the use of word \"Shall\" by the legislative\nprovisions in the Section 12 of the Act is of great significance and which raises a presumption that\nthe particular provision is imperative and makes it manifest that ordinarily the Board is under\nobligation to release the Juvenile on bail with or without surety, but the Juvenile shall not be so\nreleased in certain circumstances as latter part of the Section also uses the word \"Shall\" imposing\ncertain mandatory conditions prohibiting the release of the Juvenile by the Board. It has also been\nheld that ordinarily the bail has to be granted to the Juvenile and would be liable to be rejected only\nwhen it appears to the Board that either of the three conditions mentioned in Section 12 of the Act\nare existing. In the case of Akhilesh Kumar (supra), dealing with the case of a Juvenile, this Court\nwhile examining the correctness and validity of order rejecting application of the applicant filed\nunder Section 12 of the Act on the ground that release would defect the ends of justice, found that\nthough the Juvenile Justice Board had dismissed the bail application on the ground that release\nwould defeat the ends of justice but how the release would defeat the ends of justice has not been\nstated. In that view of the matter, this Court came to the conclusion that the orders passed by the\nCourt below are not sustainable in the eye of law.\n\n7. In the case of Rahul Mishra, (supra), the High Court of M.P. has considered the provisions\ncontained in Section 12 of the Act and held that the words notwithstanding anything contained in\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\", would indicate that the considerations which are germane\nfor granting or refusing bail to persons who are not juvenile delinquent shall not come into play for\ngranting or refusing bail to them. It was also held that the words \"ends of justice\" should be confined\nto those facts which show that the grant of bail itself is likely to result in injustice. The Juvenile\ndelinquent may appear to be guilty prima facie but he is especially protected by the Act and is\nfavourably considered for grant of bail. From the aforesaid decisions and the law propounded by\nTheir Lordships in various cases, it is clear that ordinarily bail is required to be granted to a Juvenile\nin view of the provisions contained in Section 12 of the Act. It is only when the Court finds that the\ngrounds therein are made out that the Court shall reject the application. If the order impugned in\nthe present case is scrutinized in the light of the principles as discussed above, it would at once\nappear that the impugned orders are passed on extraneous considerations. The Board while\nrejecting the application, stating that the release would defeat the ends of justice, appears to be\nguided by only one circumstance i.e. the gravity of offence, the appellate authority also relies upon\nthe same circumstance but to come to the conclusion that the release would bring the applicant into\nassociation with criminals and expose him to psychological danger. I have perused the records of the\ncase and there does not appear to be any other material or circumstance placed on record to come to\nthe conclusion that release of the applicant would either bring him in association with known\ncriminal or expose him to psychological danger or would otherwise defeat the ends of justice. In the\nabsence of any such ground appearing, the ap...",

Sri Nath Tiwari was X-rayed on the next day whereupon fracture of 4th meta carpal bone of\nhis left arm was found. On the basis of X-ray report, an addition of Section 325 IPC was made. The\npolice after having completed the formalities of the investigation submitted charge sheet against\naccused persons for the offence punishable under Sections 147/148/323/149/325/149/504/506(2)\nI.P.C. whereupon accused persons were summoned and put on trial. Learned trial court levelled a\nc h a r g e a g a i n s t a c c u s e d p e r s o n s  f o r  t h e o f f e n c e p u n i s h a b l e u n d e r S e c t i o n s\n147/148/323/149/325/149/ 504/506 (2) I.P.C. to which accused persons had pleaded not guilty and\nclaimed to be tried.\n\nIn order to prove the charge levelled against accused persons, prosecution had examined six\nwitnesses in all.

He has deposed in support of the factum of investigation. PW-5 Om Prakash Mela is a\nformal witness who had prepared chik report on the basis of written report of the incident and had\nregistered the case in the G.D. He has deposed on the said factum. PW-6 Dr. Alok Ranjan Mishra\nhad medically examined Sri Nath Tiwari on 5.7.1995 at 11:15 a.m. who had proved injured report, no\nother witness was examined by the prosecution.\n\nThe accused persons in their statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. denied the prosecution allegations\nagainst them. They in their defence filed copy of charge sheet relating to Case Crime No. 784/98 Sri\nNath Tiwari Vs. State of U.P. under Sections 323, 504, 506 IPC P.S. Makhi but no witness was\nexamined by the accused persons in their defence. After going through the evidence on record and\nafter hearing the parties, the learned trial court came to the conclusion that charge levelled against\naccused persons is made out beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly he convicted the accused\npersons for the offence punishable under Sections 147/148/323/149/325/149 and 506 IPC. Each of\nthe accused was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for a period of six months for the offence\npunishable under Section 147 I.P.C., one year rigorous imprisonment for the offence punishable\nunder section 148 I.P.C., six months rigorous imprisonment for the offence punishable under\nSection 323/149 I.P.C., three years rigorous imprisonment for the offence punishable under Section\n325/149 I.P.C. and to pay a fine of Rs.500/- and one year rigorous imprisonment for the offence\npunishable under Section 506(2) I.P.C. It was further directed that the accused who commits default\nin the payment of the fine, he shall further undergo imprisonment for one month. Feeling aggrieved\nwith the said judgment, the appeal was filed by accused persons, which was disposed of as stated\nabove. Being dissatisfied with this judgment and order passed by appellate court this revision has\nbeen filed. I have heard the learned counsel for the revisionists as well as learned AGA for the State\nand perused the record of the case along with the judgment and order, carefully. Learned counsel for\nthe revisionists has not challenged the legality and propriety of the conviction recorded by the\nappellate court against the revisionists. Learned counsel for the revisionists confined his arguments\nonly to the legality and severity of the sentence passed against the revisionists by the court below. It\nwas submitted that the accused persons were not previous convict and had no criminal history. They\nare simple villagers and have no criminal antecedents and therefore by keeping them in jail for short\nterm of one year, no useful purpose will be served and by sending them to jail, there is possibility\nthat they will come in contact with the hard criminal there and as such the accused persons ought to\nhave been dealt with under the provisions of Probation of Offender Act but the learned court below\ndid not do so and pass short term sentence as against the revisionists. Learned AGA submitted that\na prayer for releasing them on Probation of Offender Act was made by the accused persons before\nthe learned Magistrate but the same was refused and benefit of Probation of Offender Act was not\nsought for by accused persons before the appellate court and as such they should not be given the\nbenefit of Probation of Offender Act and as such there is not infirmity or irregularity in the\njudgment and order passed by the court below and the revision is liable to be dismissed in toto. I\ncarefully considered the respective submissions made by the parties.\n\nIt reveals from the perusal of the record that the revisionists and the injured of the present case are\nresident of the same village. The revisionists are not previous convict, they have no criminal history\nor...",

Allowed, subject to all just exceptions. The application is disposed of.\n\nCRL.M.C.507/2019 & CRL.M.A. 2170/2019\n\n1. This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 („Cr.PC,\nin short) for setting aside the proceedings arising out of the complaint filed by the respondent titled\nas \"Sarvesh Mahajan v. M/s Lotus Floriculture L.L.P. & Ors.\" pending before the learned\nMetropolitan Magistrate (NI Act), Tis Hazari Court, Delhi (hereinafter, the „Trial Court), as well as\nthe orders dated 17.11.2014, 06.05.2017 and 01.06.2018 („impugned orders, in short) passed by the\nTrial Court.\n\n2. The alleged brief facts, which emerge from the material on record are that, sometime in May\n2013, the respondent (complainant before the Trial Court), approached Lotus Floriculture Pvt. Ltd.\nfor purchase of its flat bearing No. 55, 3 rd Floor, Sukhdev Vihar, New Delhi. After negotiation,\nLotus Floriculture Pvt. Ltd. agreed to sell the above flat for a total consideration of Rs.\n2,20,00,000/- and in consequence, the respondent paid a sum of Rs. 20,00,000/- in cash and Rs.\n40,00,000/- through RTGS from the account of M/s Get Post Investment and Finance Service Ltd.\nand thereafter on 17.05.2013 an Agreement to sell and purchase was executed by the petitioner on\nbehalf of Lotus Floriculture Pvt. Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153868686/                                                                1                                        Vipin Kr. Gupta vs Sarvesh Mahajan on 31 January, 2019\n\nThe property under sell was lying mortgaged with HDFC as a collateral security for corporate\nguarantee given to M/s. Visa Koje Tradevision Pvt. Ltd. by Lotus Floriculture Pvt. Ltd. and was to be\nredeemed as soon as the respondent conveyed his readiness to pay the balance amount which the\nrespondent agreed to pay. However, the respondent on the pretext that the company might fail to\nredeem the property in time due to non-payment by Visa Koje to the bank, demanded security for\nthe earnest money paid. Therefore, Lotus Floriculture Pvt. Ltd. issued an undated cheque bearing\nNo. 003858 drawn on Union Bank of India, Kailash Colony, New Delhi for Rs. 60,00,000/- without\nmentioning the name of the payee. The petitioner being the Authorised Signatory of the company in\ngood faith had issued the cheque by filing the amount in words as well as in figures to the\nrespondent with an assurance that the said cheque shall not be misused by the respondent and shall\nbe returned after the property is redeemed.\n\nIn the meantime, Lotus Floriculture Pvt. Ltd. was converted into Limited Liability Partnership on\n24.03.2014 and all the assets and liabilities of the company were taken over by the successor entity\nby operation of law and the respondent was accordingly informed that the new entity Lotus\nFloriculture LLP was ready to execute sale deed in his favour against the balance consideration.\n\n3. Subsequently, the respondent did not come forward to pay the balance amount nor came forward\nto perform his part of the Agreement to sell dated 17.05.2013 however, the respondent\nunauthorizedly presented the aforesaid cheque bearing No. 003858 for encashment which got\ndishonoured and in consequence of which, the respondent firstly sent a legal notice dated 5.09.2014\nand thereafter filed a complaint against the petitioner and the other co-accused in the case for the\noffence committed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 („NI Act, in short)\nwhich got registered and the Trial Court vide order dated 17.11.2014 issued summons to the\npetitioner, and the other co- accused namely, Lotus Floriculture LLP. and the partners of the Lotus\nFloriculture LLP. Thereafter, vide order dated 3.10.2016 the names of the accused Nos. 2 & 3\n(partners of Lotus Floriculture LLP) were deleted from the array of parties on the statement made\nby the respondent, that he does not want to prosecute them, leaving the petitioner and accused No.\n1-Lotus Floriculture LLP to face the proceedings under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the NI\nAct.\n\n4. Subsequently, an application was filed by the petitioner to discharge the petitioner from the case.\nHowever, the Trial Court vide order dated 06.05.2017 observed that no ground was made out to\ndischarge the petitioner from the case since sufficient material is on record to frame notice against\nthe petitioner.\n\n5. Thereafter, vide the impugned order dated 1.06.2018 the Trial Court framed notice under Section\n251 of the Cr.PC, to which the petitioner pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.\n\n6. The petitioner has challenged the afore-mentioned orders dated 17.11.2014 06.05.2017 and\n01.06.2018 and also the proceedings which are pending before the Trial Court.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner, on the query of the Court, admitted that the cheque bears the\nsignatures of the petitioner but however, submitted that the petitioner was not a Director at the time\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153868686/                                                                2                                        Vipin Kr. Gupta vs Sarvesh Mahajan on 31 January, 2019\n\nof issuance/ signing of the cheque and the same was without consideration, therefore, he is not\nliable to make the payment or even to be summoned in the matter.\n\n8. Now, this Court would like to deal with firstly, the order dated 17.11.2014. The order dated\n17.11.2014 has been assailed now, after more than four years of the passing of the said impugned\norder. There is neither any plausible explanation nor any sufficient cause in the petition to approach\nthis Court after such an inordinate delay. I have no hesitation to hold that if the Court fails to take\ninto consideration delay and laches, while invoking the powers of the High Court under Section 482\nof the Cr. PC, without any reasonable ground, there would be no end to the litigation, as a\nconsequence whereof, neither any trial would be proceeded nor any trial would be concluded before\nthe Trial Court. The impugned order dated 17.11.2014 is barred by the principle of delay and laches,\nto invoke the powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr. PC, hence, challenge to the\nimpugned order dated 17.11.2014 cannot be entertained at this stage after such a long, inordinate\ndelay and laches, hence is not liable to be set aside on this ground alone. In this regard, see Rajesh\nChetwal v. State, in Crl.M.C.1656/2011, decided by this Court on 24.8.2011, Inder Mohan & Ors. vs.\nThe State, 1972 Crl. LJ 1569, Gopal Chauhan v. Smt. Satya & Anr., 1979 Crl.LJ 446 and Bata & Ors.\nv. Anama Behera, 1990 Crl.LJ 1110.\n\n9. Even otherwise, let me examine the question, whether the Trial Court was justified or not in\nissuing summons to the petitioner vide the impugned order dated 17.11.2014.\n\n10. It is a well settled law that the Trial Court is only expected to consider the prima facie case at this\nstage to proceed against the accused and not whether the case would result in conviction.\n\n11. It needs no elaboration that at this stage the Court is required to evaluate the material and\ndocuments which have been placed on record by the petitioner and taken at the face value thereof,\nwhether existence of the ingredients constituting the alleged offence or offences are prima-facie\ndisclosed or not.\n\n12. In Rajiv Thapar & Ors. v. Madan Lal Kapoor , (2013) 3 SCC 330, it has been held by the Supreme\nCourt as under:\n\n       \"28. The High Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.,\n      must make a just and rightful choice. This is not a stage of evaluating the truthfulness\n       or otherwise of allegations levelled by the prosecution/complainant against the\n       accused. Likewise, it is not a stage for determining how weighty the defences raised\n      on behalf of the accused is. Even if the accused is successful in showing some\n       suspicion or doubt, in the allegations levelled by the prosecution/complainant, it\n      would be impermissible to discharge the accused before trial. This is so, because it\n    w o u l d r e s u l t  i n g i v i n g  f i n a l i t y  t o  t h e a c c u s a t i o n s  l e v e l l e d b y  t h e\n       prosecution/complainant, without allowing the prosecution or the complainant to\n      adduce evidence to substantiate the same. The converse is, however, not true,\n       because even if trial is proceeded with, the accused is not subjected to any irreparable\n       consequences. The accused would still be in a position to succeed, by establishing his\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153868686/                                                                3                                        Vipin Kr. Gupta vs Sarvesh Mahajan on 31 January, 2019\n\n       defences by producing evidence in accordance with law. There is an endless list of\n      judgments rendered by this Court declaring the legal position, that in a case where\n       the prosecution/complainant has levelled allegations bringing out all ingredients of\n      the cha...",

On 28th August 2009, at around 10:45 pm, he had dinner with his wife, Reshma (PW-11) and his two children - son Mohd. Arman, aged 31/2 years and daughter Alia, aged about 8 months.

ACMM, and every other\nproceeding undertaken in the said cases respectively, on the grounds that the FIRs do not disclose\ncommission of any cognizable offence as the dispute between the parties is purely civil in nature.\nThe petitioners are co-accused in the aforesaid cases, in respect whereof they have preferred these\npetitions. The particulars of each of these cases are tabulated hereinbelow. The names of the\nrespective petitioners have been highlighted for facility, as appearing in the column of \"Accused\":\n\n        S.

As per the case of the prosecution, the petitioners - who are the Directors and Promoters of\nSunair, and Sunair approached VLS Finance Ltd (VLS, for short), respondent No. 2 herein around\nDecember 1994, with a proposal to finance their hotel project. VLS, Sunair, Vipul Gupta and S.P.\nGupta entered into an MOU dated 11.03.1995. The petitioners represented that they would invest\nRs. 21 Crores towards equity share capital in the company, namely Sunair, in case VLS invests Rs. 7\nCrore towards 25% equity share capital in Sunair. As per the prosecution, VLS invested the said\namount of Rs. 7 Crores.\n\n3. VLS made complaints alleging the commission of offences under various sections of the IPC,\nincluding Sections 420, 406, 409, 468, 471 and 120B by the petitioners, on the ground that the\npetitioners had not made their contribution of Rs. 21 Crores in the equity share capital of Sunair and\nhad manipulated their accounts to show the making of such share capital investment. On the basis\nof the complaints made by the complainant VLS, the aforesaid FIRs came to be registered and\ninvestigated. The last FIR, i.e. FIR No.315/2005 was registered on the basis of a subsequent event/\ncause of action under Section 380, 411 read with Section 120B IPC.\n\n4. Initially, a quashing petition being W.P. (CRL.) No. 1163/2003 (which appears to have been\nwrongly mentioned in the aforesaid petitions as Cr. Misc(M) 1163/2003) was filed vis-à-vis FIR No.\n99/2002, which was dismissed on 24.03.2005. The Special Leave Petition being SLP Crl MP\nNo.14246/2005 was also dismissed by the Supreme Court vide order dated 03.07.2006.\n\n5. The petitioner S.P. Gupta, preferred a writ petition, being W.P.(Crl.) No. 498/2005 for quashing\nof FIR No 148 of 2002 in this Court. After filing of the charge sheet in FIR No. 99 of 2002, the\naccused in the said FIR No. 99/2002 including the petitioner Vipul Gupta, preferred quashing\npetitions before this Court being Crl. M.C. Nos. 2142/2007, 2229/2007 and 1988/2008. The\npetitioner S.P. Gupta withdrew the aforesaid petition being W.P. (Crl) 498/2005, and the Court vide\norder dated 04.03.2010 granted liberty to the petitioner to raise all issues before the learned Trial\nCo...",

    "facts_of_case": "after lapse of time in the back drop of the witness being rustic villagers and would in itself cannot be made ground to discard their testimonies in toto. Mere opening of a saving account in the name of deceased by husband accused and keeping a credit balance therein of around Rs 50,000/− would in itself will not be sufficient to draw a presumption that neither accused had any occasion to demand dowry nor they were greedy. Inability of the brothers and mother of deceased to take care of the minor son of deceased later to death of deceased would not make their testimonies unworthy of credence. In terms of law laid in Surinder Kumar vs State (Delhi Administration), 2010 Cri.L.J (NOC) 53 (DEL.) merely because deceased and her relatives choose not to make any complaint regarding dowry demand or ill treatment given to her by accused, such fact cannot be a ground to discard their testimonies. State Vs. Rambir Singh etc. 46. DW5 who acted as mediator for marriage of deceased with accused Rambir made vivid and clear that she was not knowing what talks took place in between family of husband/accused Rambir and the family of Balwan Singh, father of deceased, in her absence. DW5 was also not knowing as to on how many occasions before or after the marriage of accused Rambir, the family members of Rambir and Rambir himself had gone to the house of said Balwan Singh. Though DW5 stated that when she was married, no plot was given as that was not the custom but fact remains that the material prosecution witnesses including PW1 testified that two plots were given to Rambir's Mausi's son on their demand. How many were the sons of the mausi's of Rambir and how many were the mausis of the accused Rambir, has neither come in the prosecution evidence nor in the defence evidence. Accordingly testimony of DW5 is also of no help to the defence. 47. It is also understandable that in view of his relation as maternal uncle, DW1 would be interested in acquittal of his nephew Sonu @ Pankaj and in regard to his version that in the summer State Vs. Rambir Singh etc. vacations said accused Sonu @ Pankaj was staying with DW1, there is no corroboration to testimony of DW1 and even to that effect it had not been the case of defence in the course of cross examination of the material prosecution witnesses. All the more, there exist allegations of harassment and beatings inter alia by accused Sonu @ Pankaj upon the person of the deceased in connection with the demand of dowry. Within 15 days of marriage of deceased with accused Rambir, the greed of accused persons surfaced by way of demands of dowry including cash and car on the part of the accused persons from the deceased which continued till the deceased survived. In the set of elicited facts and circumstances, there is no option but to raise the presumption envisaged under Section 113 B of the Indian Evidence Act since the deceased died otherwise than in normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage, was subjected to cruelty Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139565073/ 20 State vs . Rambir Singh Etc. on 21 April, 2011 and harassment by the accused persons, her husband and relatives of husband and such cruelty and harassment was in connection with demand of dowry which persisted and meted out to the deceased soon before her death. The accused persons joined each other in acts of harassment of deceased, subjecting her to beatings, cruelty State Vs. Rambir Singh etc. and demands of dowry and caused the dowry death. 48. The accused failed to rebut the said presumption by any cogent evidence or to prove that the deceased had committed suicide in anger and tension on the aspect of her husband accused Rambir going alone to his place of posting outstation not taking her along, in the backdrop of the fact of accused not bringing on record any document requiring the accused Rambir by his alleged employer to have asked him to join the services at outstation posting within 20 days of his return to Delhi on 05/06/2004. 49. In view of aforesaid discussions, I am of the considered opinion that though the prosecution has been unsuccessful in proving its case against the accused Rambir Singh and Santosh for offence",

Gurdit Singh s/o Natha Singh, father of the\ncomplainant had gone missing in the year 1979 and his whereabouts were not known. He had\nexecuted a registered Will on 2.12.1976 in favour of the complainant, his wife and son Manjit Singh\nregarding the house bearing No.B-II/1435 and 1436 situated in Arya Nagar, Hoshiarpur and also\nregarding the land measuring 15 Kanals situated in village Islamabad Bajwara, District Hoshiarpur.\n\nOn the presumed death of Gurdit Singh after seven years of his missing, mutation proceedings were\ninitiated by the complainant, which were hotly contested by the sons of Jagdish Singh i.e. Accused -\nappellants as well as Amarjit Singh and Surjit Singh, so also Jagdish Singh on the basis of a Will\ndated 3.5.1982, purported to have been executed by Gurdit Singh in favour of Amarjit Singh,\nMohinder Pal Singh, Jagtar Singh, Gurmit Singh and Surjit Singh (all accused), whereas, Gurbax\nSingh and Channan Singh, who are stated to be scribe and attesting witnesses, respectively, have\nalready died.\n\nJagdish Singh and Channan Singh had also died during trial, whereas, the accused Amarjit Singh\nwas discharged at the charge stage.\n\nThe civil litigation also started between the parties. The complainant, his wife and son filed a suit for\ndeclaration and mandatory injunction on the basis of the Will dated 2.12.1976, which was hotly\ncontested by all the accused and they set up their claim on the basis of the Will dated 3.5.1982. The\nAssistant Collector Ist Grade, Hoshiarpur, while ignoring the Will dated 3.5.1982 ordered to\nsanction the mutation on the basis of the Will dated 2.12.1976. The Civil Court also refused to place\nreliance on the said Will, the appeal against which was also dismissed by Additional District Judge,\nHoshiarpur on 18.5.1992. While dismissing the appeal, the Additional District Judge observed that\nthe said Will was forged one.\n\nOn 2.8.1984, while coming to know about the forging of the Will by the accused, the complainant\nfiled a complaint under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, alleging\nthat the Will dated 3.5.1982 was handiwork of the sons of Jagdish Singh, so also of the scribe and\nthe attesting witnesses. It was also alleged that actually Amarjit Singh propounded the forged Will.\n\nIn the pre-charge evidence, the complainant examined Udham Singh (PW1), Sarup Singh -\ncomplainant (PW2) and Arvind Sud, Hand- writing expert, Hoshiarpur (PW3).\n\nAfter recording the preliminary evidence, the Court summoned the accused and after recording the\npre-charge evidence, the Trial Court framed the charge against accused Mohinder Pal Singh, Jagtar\nSingh, Gurmit Singh and Gurbax Singh under Sections 120-B/420/467/468 read with Section\n149/471 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThereafter, the complainant examined one more witness, namely, Naresh Kumar (PW4), Clerk in\nthe Record Room at Hoshiarpur, who had brought the partition file titled 'Gurdit Singh vs. Jagdish\nSingh', decided by the Tehsildar on 25.3.1981 and closed the prosecution evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53423244/                                                                 2                     Mohinder Pal Singh And Others vs The State Of Punjab And Another on 15 March, 2010\n\nWhen examined under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the accused denied all the\nincriminating circumstances appearing against them and pleaded their false implication in the case.\nAll the accused further explained that the Will dated 3.5.1982 propounded by them is a genuine\ndocument. However, they while admitting the previous litigation, took the stand that the Will was\nwrongly ignored by the Civil Judge as well as the Appellate Court. They also averred that though the\ncomplainant wanted to grab whole of the property, but at the same time, they have also pleaded\nhaving compromised with the complainant. In defence, they examined Gurdev Singh, Clerk in the\noffice of DC, Hoshiarpur (DW1); Ram Sarup, Assistant in the office of District & Sessions Judge,\nHoshiarpur (DW2); Manoj Kumar, Record Keeper, DMC, Hospital, Ludhiana (D3); Mohinder Prit\nSingh r/o Mohan Lal Oswal Cancer Hospital, Ludhiana (DW4); V.K.Rana, UDC in the Passport\nOffice, Chandigarh (DW5); Garish Chander, Peon, Bar Council of India (DW6); HC Devinder Singh\n(DW7); Sadhu Singh (DW8) and Rama Kant, Clerk, Judicial Record Room, Hoshiarpur (DW9).\n\nThe Trial Court while acquitting the accused Mohinder Pal Singh, Jagtar Singh and Gurmit Singh of\nthe charges under Sections 420, 467,468, 120-B IPC, convicted them under Section 471 read with\nSection 149 IPC. Similarly, Gurbax Singh was convicted and sentenced under Section 467 IPC. Both\nappeals preferred by the aforesaid accused were dismissed with the modification in the sentence,\nwhich was reduced from two years to 1½ years, each, without any alteration in the sentence of fine.\n\nThe counsel for the petitioners has urged that both the courts below have mainly relied upon the\njudgment passed by the Civil Court declaring the Will to be forged one and did not appreciate the\nevidence led by the accused independently, in order to reach the conclusion with regard to the\ngenuineness of the document. No sufficient evidence has been led by the complainant before the\nTrial Court for proving the fact that the Will was not executed by Gurdit Singh and does not bear his\nsignatures. Secondly, it was urged that since the Will was produced in court, which was found to be\nforged, therefore, the provisions of Section 195(1)(b)(ii) of the Code of Criminal Procedure were\nattracted and the Court could take the cognizance of the offence only on filing of the complaint by\nthe Court itself or the Court, which was superior to the Court, where the Will was presented.\n\nBefore I touch the point, it needs mention that the provisions of Section 195 are not attracted in this\ncase. The said provisions are applicable only in cases where some forgery or tampering is done to a\ndocument when it is already in the custody of the Court and in cases where the document is forged\nor tampered outside the Court, and, thereafter, produced in Court, then the said provisions of\nSection 195(1)(b)(ii) are not applicable and no enquiry under Section 340 could be envisaged in such\na case. The Full Bench of this Court in case of Mohan Lal Sharma vs. Punjab and Haryana High\nCourt (P&H), 1999(2) RCR(Crl.) 223 observed that where a document had been forged out of court\nand thereafter produced in court holding of enquiry under S.340 Cr.P.C. is not a must for institution\nof proceedings against the accused.\n\nIn the instant case also, the Will was forged outside the Court and then produced, therefore, the\naforesaid provisions are not attracted and the complaint before the Court for the relevant offences\nwas maintainable.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53423244/                                                                 3                     Mohinder Pal Singh And Others vs The State Of Punjab And Another on 15 March, 2010\n\nNow, I lay my hands to decide over the first issue. In this regard, it is observed that undisputedly the\nWill executed by Gurdit Singh on 2.12.1976 was made the basis by the complainant for claiming\nownership of the property. The accused came forward with the Will dated 3.5.1982 purported to\nhave been executed by Gurdit Singh in favour of Jagdish Singh and his sons. The Court of Civil\nJudge (Sr.Divn.), Hoshiarpur vide its judgment dated 1.10.1991 while ignoring the Will d...",

The appellant was convicted under Section 304 B and 498 A of the Indian Penal\nCode. He was sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of 10 years and to pay a\nfine of `4000/- for offence under Section 304 B of Indian Penal Code or in default of payment of\nfine to further undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for 2 years.

However, all the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.\n\nIn brief facts of the case, are that FIR Ex.PB was recorded on the statement of Smt. Raj Kaur victim\nrecorded by Judicial Magistrate on 10.4.1998.\n\nIn her statement Ex.PB Smt. Raj Kaur stated that on 9.04.1998 at about 3:00-4:00 p.m.Baksha\nSingh, Jassa Singh, Amir Singh all brothers of her husband and her husband Nishan Singh poured\nkerosene oil upon her from the stove. Ranjit Kaur, Paramjit Kaur, Raminder Kaur and Harbans\nKaur were present there and caught hold of her and sprinkled kerosene oil upon her. Thereafter, her\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/50852496/                                                                 1                                Nishan Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 18 November, 2010\n\nhusband Nishan Singh set fire by lighting match stick. She further stated that they used to demand\ndowry from her. Sometimes they demanded car and sometimes scooter. Her husband picked up\nstove lying in the room, opened the same and poured Kerosene oil upon her. Chanan Singh uncle of\nHarbans Kaur asked all of them to burn her. She stated that her relations with her husband were not\ncordial and he did not behave with her properly. Her mother-in-law Pritam Kaur tried to rescue her\nby putting clothes and water to extinguish the fire. She was brought to the hospital by her father and\nbrother. She stated that till about one year of her marriage she did not tell anything to her parents\nwith the hope that the better senses might prevail upon her in-laws. In the end, she stated that she is\nnot willing to go to her in-laws' house. This statement was handed over to the ASI, Sh. Chand Ram,\nwho sent it to the Police Station for registration of case. On this statement FIR No.216 dated\n10.04.1998 was registered. Smt. Raj Kaur died on 14.04.1998 in the hospital.\n\nAfter completion of investigation a report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted to the illaqa\nMagistrate against Nishan Singh only. During investigation Baksha Singh, Jassa Singh, Amir Singh\nsons of Davinder Singh, Chanan Singh, Ranjit Kaur, Harjit Singh, Paramjit Kaur, Ravinder Kaur and\nHarbans kaur were found to be innocent.\n\nThe complainant was not satisfied with the investigation and approached this Court vide Criminal\nWrit Petition No.620 of 1998. This Court vide order dated 7.05.1998 directed the Superintendent of\nPolice to supervise the investigation or to depute a Gazetted Officer for supervision of the\ninvestigation.\n\nFinding prima facie case against Nishan Singh, the learned trial Court framed charge against him\nunder Sections 302/304B/498A of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nAfter recording the statement of two prosecution witnesses, the prosecution approached the trial\nCourt with an application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. for summoning of 8 more accused who were\ndeclared innocent by the Police. But the same was subsequently dismissed as withdrawn on\n11.8.1999.\n\nIn order to prove its case the prosecution examined Dr. Parveen Garg, PW-4, to prove that Smt. Raj\nKaur suffered 90 per cent burns and that he declared the patient fit to make a statement. Dr.\nSubhash Juneja, PW-5, conducted the postmortem examination on 15.04.1998 and opined that the\ncause of death was due to extensive burns which were ante mortem and sufficient to cause death in\nthe ordinary course of nature. Parminder Singh PW-2 proved site plan Ex.PD of the place of\noccurrence. Chanan Singh alias Gurcharan Singh PW-6 is the father of the victim who was declared\nhostile and allowed to be cross- examined. Satnam Singh (appellant-7) is the brother of Smt. Raj\nKaur also did not support the case of the prosecution and was declared hostile. Pritam Kaur, PW-8,\nis mother of Nishan Singh accused she was also declared hostile and was also cross-examined. ASI,\nRanbir Singh was examined as PW-9, to prove that on receipt of ruqqa Ex.PE, he moved an\napplication before J.M.I.C., Karnal at his residence and took him to Hospital for recording the\nstatement of Smt. Raj Kaur. He proved a copy of statement Ex.PB/1 and formal FIR Ex.PB/3.\nJagdish Chand, Junior Engineer, Irrigation Department was examined as PW-10.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/50852496/                                                                 2                                Nishan Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 18 November, 2010\n\nIn this statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. the accused pleaded that he was innocent. He further\nstated that he was earlier married to Jasbir Kaur, who died of cancer, leaving behind two daughters,\none aged 6 years, another four years at the time of her death. He had disclosed this fact to the\nparents of his second wife, however, she was never informed about this fact by her parents. She only\ncame to know about this fact after she started staying with the appellant as his wife. She was highly\nannoyed because of the responsibility of bringing up his two daughters from his earlier wife, which\nfell upon her inexperienced shoulders. She also gave birth to a daughter.\n\nA cousin sister of his wife was to be married prior to 9-4-1998 and at the time of marriage Raj Kaur\nwas left by appellant at her parental house for two days. He came back to his Dera after attending\nthe said marriage. Raj Kaur did not come to his Dera for more than 20 days and was brought back\nby her brother, Sahab Singh, on the day of occurrence itself, in a hired van at about 2-30 p.m. on\n9-4-1998. The husband abused her and when Satnam Singh intervened the husband gave him fist\nand slap blows. Raj Kaur went inside the house in a highly agitated state of mind and came out of\nthe room after setting herself on fire after pouring kerosene oil on herself. The husband, his brother\nand his mother extinguished the fire. Her brother left immediately in the same van, for his house.\nThe husband and his mother etc. took Raj Kaur to Assandh to the hospital of Dr. Sharma where she\nwas given First Aid. Jagtar Singh r/o village Rohar met Raj kaur in the hospital and he made\nenquiries from her as to how she sustained burn injuries. She told him the story as narrated above.\nThen her father Chanan Singh and brother Satnam Singh also came to the hospital and she told her\nfather as to how and why she had set herself on fire. Thereafter Chanan Singh advised her not to\nmake such a statement before any authority, otherwise she would be prosecuted for committing\nsuicide. Chanan Singh was highly annoyed with the husband and his family, so, he advised Raj Kaur\nto make statement involving her husband and his family and uncle Chanan Singh, Sarpanch for\ncausing her burn injuries. The statement recorded by Magistrate was also as a result of prompting\nby her father. She was not in fit state of mind at the time of recording her statement and the\nstatement was recorded at the behest of her father. It was stated by the complainant that the\ndeceased had been found with great difficulty as in Jat sikhs there are more men than women. There\nwas no question of demand of dowry by any member of his family and no such demand was ever\nmade or any harassment was ever made to Raj Kaur. He further stated that Chanan Singh is a truck\ndealer and has been challaned in various cases. The entire family indulges in various crimes and\nbecause of Chanan Singh, the present shape has been given to the case. It is stated that the present\ncase is false and fabricated.\n\nIn defence Jagtar Singh was examined as PW-1.\n\nThe learned trial Court convicted and sentenced the appellant has referred to above this appeal is\npreferred.\n\nThe testimonies of Chanan Singh alias Gurcharan Singh PW- 6, father of the deceased, Satnam\nSingh, PW-7, brother of the deceased and Pritam Kaur, PW-9, mother of the accused are very much\nrelevant. PW-6 Chanan Singh alias Gurcharan Singh states that Nishan Singh gave slap blows to his\ndaughter in the presence of his son Satnam Singh PW-7. The accused felt offended because the\ndeceased overstayed at her parental house without permission of her husband Nishan Singh\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/50852496/                                                                 3                                Nishan Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 18 November, 2010\n\naccused.

This judgment of mine shall dispose of two appeals, namely, CRA Nos.894-SB and 943-SB of\n2000, having arisen out of the same incident. However, the facts are being derived from CRA\nNo.CRA No.894- SB of 2000.\n\n2. The present appeal has been directed against the judgment and order dated 28/30.08.2000\n(hereinafter referred to as 'impugned judgment') Criminal Appeal No.894-SB of 2000 and another 2\npassed by the learned Sessions Judge, Karnal (hereinafter referred to as 'trial Court'), whereby the\naccused-appellants have been convicted for the commission of offence punishable under Sections\n304-B and 498-A IPC. The learned trial Court sentenced the appellants to undergo rigorous\nimprisonment for a period of seven years each under Section 304-B IPC. The appellants have been\nfurther sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay a fine of\nRs.5000/- each or in default, to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months\neach under Section 498-A IPC. However, both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.\n\n3. Briefly stated, facts of the present case, as emanating from the statement of complainant, Angrez\nSingh, PW4, are that the deceased, Harjinder Kaur, real sister of Sukhwant Singh, PW7, was married\nwith the accused, Sher Singh, on 22.2.1997 and sufficient dowry was given at the time of marriage.\nTwo months prior to the occurrence, she along with her brothers, Sukhwant Singh and Jaswant\nSingh, visited the house of the complainant Angrej Singh, uncle of the deceased and told him that\naccused Sher Singh; his father Jarnail Singh; his mother Sukhvinder Kaur and his brother Devinder\nSingh, had been harassing and maltreating her and had been demanding motor cycle and fridge,\nand sought advise of the complainant in this regard. The complainant, Angrez Singh, told the\ndeceased that the motor cycle and fridge would be provided at the time of the marriage of her\nbrothers and she was thereafter sent to her matrimonial home.\n\n4. On 7.2.1998, Rajwant Singh informed the complainant, Angrez Singh, that Harjinder Kaur had\ndied at her matrimonial home in Village Criminal Appeal No.894-SB of 2000 and another 3 Danoli.\nThereafter, the complainant, Sukhwant Singh and Jaswant Singh (brothers of the deceased) along\nwith other respectables of the Village visited the matrimonial home of the deceased and found that\nHarjinder Kaur was lying dead in the house. On enquiry, it was found that due to the harassment\nmeted out to her by the accused for demand of dowry, she had consumed poison. Report Ex.PE, of\nthe Chemical Examiner confirmed the consuming of aluminium phosphide.\n\n5. The complainant then reported the matter to the Police on 8.2.1998 at about 10.00-10.30 a.m. on\nthe basis of which, formal FIR, Ex.PF, was recorded at Police Station, Assandh, investigations were\nconducted and upon presentation of the challan against the accused- appellants, the case was\ncommitted to the Court of Sessions.\n\n6. The accused were charge-sheeted for the commission of offence punishable under Sections 304-B\nand 498-A IPC, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.\n\n7. In order to substantiate its case against the accused, the prosecution examined as many as eight\nwitnesses, namely, HC Jagbir Singh as PW1; Constable Surinder Kumar as PW2; Dr. Y.P. Singh, as\nPW3; Angrez Singh, complainant, as PW4; Mewa Singh as PW5; Rajwant Singh as PW6; Sukhwant\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80936732/                                                                 2                            Sher Singh Alias Partapa vs State Of Haryana on 16 December, 2010\n\nSingh, brother of the deceased, as PW7; and ASI Mohinderpal, Investigating Officer, as PW8.\n\n8. The accused were examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C. wherein all the incriminating\ncircumstances and evidence appearing against them were put to them to which the accused persons\ndenied and pleaded false implication. The accused did not examine any witness in their defence.\n\n9. After hearing learned counsel for both the parties and Criminal Appeal No.894-SB of 2000 and\nanother 4 considering material/evidence on record, the learned trial Court has convicted and\nsentenced the appellants for the offence and term as indicated at the outset of this judgment.\n\n10. The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that in the instant case, there is unexplained\ndelay of more than 20 hours in lodging the the FIR. As per the statement of complainant, the FIR\nwas recorded on 8.2.1998, at 11.00 a.m. Learned counsel has submitted that the complainant\nreached Village Danoli, the matrimonial home of the deceased after the receipt of information\nregarding the death of Harjinder Kaur, deceased, on 7.2.1998 at 11.00 p.m. However, the FIR came\ninto existence on 8.2.1998 at 10.00 a.m. i.e., after a delay of more than 20 hours though the Police\nhad reached the Village on the same day.\n\n11. The learned counsel has further submitted that once there is a positive finding of the fact and the\ndemand of motorcycle is not proved, the judgment of conviction and order of sentence ought not to\nhave been passed.\n\n12. The learned counsel has further submitted that the accused- appellants, Devinder Singh,\nbrother-in-law; Jarnail Singh, father-in-law; and Sukhvinder Kaur, mother in law; of the deceased,\nwho were residing separately and would not have been beneficiaries in the eventuality of demand\nhaving been met.\n\n13. The learned counsel has further submitted that there is no positive proof that any demand with\nregard to dowry was raised by the appellants soon before the death of the deceased or that she was\nsubject to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand of dowry. On an application\nof the provisions of Section 113 B of the Evidence Act on the Criminal Appeal No.894-SB of 2000\nand another 5 facts of the present case, no inference can be drawn that the deceased, Harjinder\nKaur, was subjected to cruelty or harassment with regard to the demand of dowry, soon before her\ndeath.\n\n14. Learned counsel has further referred that there is no evidence on record that any meeting has\nbeen convened either by the Panchayat or by the relatives of the deceased in connection with the\nalleged demand of dowry.\n\n15. Learned counsel has further submitted that there are material improvements in the statements\nof complainant-Angrez Singh, PW4. In his cross-examination, this witness has admitted that he had\nnot stated to the Police that the deceased had come to him two months prior to the date of\noccurrence. It has further come on record that at the time of betrothal ceremony, there was no\ndemand. This witness has also admitted that after the marriage, he never visited the house of the\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80936732/                                                                 3                            Sher Singh Alias Partapa vs State Of Haryana on 16 December, 2010\n\naccused and he came to know for the first time regarding the demand of dowry two months prior to\nthe death of Harjinder Kaur. He has also admitted that he did not visit the matrimonial house of the\ndeceased.

No.5246/2010:\n\n      The petitioners herein are arrayed as respondents in proceedings initiated by the\n      respondent under the provision of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act,\n     2005 (for brevity, 'Act'). They are her in-laws. She is wife of V. Santosh\n      Nagammanavar, S/o petitioner No.1 and\n\n2 and brother of 3rd and 5th petitioner. 4th petitioner is a married daughter of the family.\n\n2. The allegation of the respondent in her petition under Section 12 of the Act in essence was, she\nwas living with her in-laws, pursuant to her marriage, she went to UK with her husband on\n20.05.2006. He was taking good care of her. However, when these petitioners contacted him over\nphone, he would pick up quarrel with her for trivial reasons. During December 2006, he brought her\nback to India and left her in the matrimonial house by insisting her to take up course in computers\nand staying in her parents' house, he returned to UK. Thereafter, from June 2007, he stopped\ntelephonic calls to her. He issued a legal notice calling upon her to consent for divorce. She had\ntolerated all the harassment of dowry inflicted on her by the in-laws. During her stay at her in-laws\nhouse, she was beaten, tortured, abused on one pretext or the other that she is unemployed and she\nhas no other source of income. She was willing to go and reside at the matrimonial house, however,\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151895005/                                                                3                          Smt Nagarathnamma vs Smt M S Vanithashree on 1 February, 2016\n\nher in-laws in collusion with their daughters, son have been threatening that they would not allow\nher to stay in the matrimonial house. She intended to go and reside with the respondent/husband,\nhowever, she fears harassment and danger to her life...etc.\n\n3. Sri. Gururaj Joshi, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that 3rd petitioner is a deserted\nwoman, after marriage she is staying with her parents. 4th petitioner is residing at UK on the\nassignment of her husband herself. 5th petitioner is residing away from his parents with his family\nin a house constructed of his own. He is also in abroad on assignment of his profession.\nRespondent/wife does not have any matrimonial house in Bengaluru. Whenever her husband visits\nIndia, he resides with his brother/5th petitioner. Several proceedings are pending between the\npetitioners and her husband. Divorce petition is filed by her husband whereas respondent has filed a\npetition for restitution of conjugal rights. Criminal case was also initiated on her husband. This\ncourt quashed the complaint against all in-laws except her husband-Dr. Santosh. She is not entitled\nfor any relief against the respondent in the present petition. Without application of mind, learned\nMagistrate has issued process against them. Notice issued without calling for Child Development\nand Protection Officer Report is erroneous. Petitioner No.1 and 3 being female relatives cannot be\narrayed as respondents within the meaning of Section 2q of the Act. None of them are having\ndomestic relationship with her within the meaning of Section 2(f) of the Act. The complaint filed by\nher against these petitioners ended up with B report. Further investigation is quashed by this Court.\nThere is no shared household within the meaning of Section 2(f) of the Act. Sections 18, 19 and 20 of\nthe Act are not applicable so far as these petitioners are concerned. They cannot be called upon to\npay monetary relief to the respondent under Section 20(2) of the Act. Hence, the entire proceedings\nis liable to be quashed in the light of the judgments of the Apex Court and in catena of the judicial\npronouncements passed by this Court.\n\n4. Sri. L. Harish Kumar, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the petition filed by her\nhusband for divorce is dismissed and her petition for restitution of conjugal rights is allowed. She\nwas prevented by her in- laws in joining the matrimonial house at Bengaluru. Hence, she was\ncompelled to file petition for protection and maintenance orders under the Act. The proceedings\nunder the Act being civil in nature, the provision of Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is not applicable in the\npresent circumstances. As per the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Sou.\n\nSandhya Manoj Wankhade Vs. Manoj Bhimrao Wankhade & Ors. in Crl. Appeal No.271/2011, dated\n31.01.2011, wherein it has observed that \"respondent\" as under Section 2(q) of the Act applies to the\nfemale members also. Earlier petition filed by these petitioners in WP No.48009/2012(GM-Res)\nwas dismissed on 06.03.2015. Since the petition filed by her husband for divorce is dismissed, the\npetitioners herein are to be restrained from committing violence against her. The contentions raised\nin this petition can be advanced by them before the trial Court. It is too premature to quash the\nentire proceedings as held in similar circumstances by this Court. They cannot respect for the law\nsince they are not paying maintenance amount, they are not entitled for any relief. The petition is\nliable to rejected.\n\n5. On survey of the entire complaint, specific allegation against these petitioners, the husband in\ncollusion with his family members/petitioners harassed his wife to a maximum extent for dowry,\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151895005/                                                                4                          Smt Nagarathnamma vs Smt M S Vanithashree on 1 February, 2016\n\nmarriage was celebrated on 08.05.2006.

Act. It is alleged in the complaint that, the accused is known to the complainant and the accused had approached the complainant for financial help of Crl.A. No.25086/2020 Rs.8,00,000/- for the purpose of construction of his house in first week of October 2015, since the complainant knew that the accused was under need of money, hence the complainant has paid hand loan of Rs.8,00,000/- to the accused on 1st week of October 2015 by way of cash, at the time of taking loan the accused has promised to repay the said hand loan within one year from the date of loan, after completion of one year the complainant had demanded the accused for repayment of hand loan of Rs.8,00,000/-, on repeated demand, the accused has issued two cheques bearing No.066519, dated 7.11.2016 for sum of Rs.4,00,000/- and cheque No.066520, dated 7.11.2016 for sum of Rs.4,00,000/-, both drawn on State Bank of India, Mahadevapura Branch, Bangaluru, in favour of complainant towards payment of hand loan, believing the words of the accused, the complainant has presented the said cheques for encashment on 22.11.2016, but said cheques were returned with a bank endorsement dated 22.11.2016 \"Account Closed\". Thereafter, the complainant Crl.A. No.25086/2020 had approached the accused and brought the notice on dishonour of cheque, but accused did not heed the request of the complainant, hence the complainant got issued legal notice dated 16.12.2016 calling upon the accused to pay the cheque amount within 15 days from the date of receipt of notice. Due to typographical error it is mentioned in the notice as State Bank of Mysore instead of State Bank of India, hence the complainant got issued corrigendum notice dated 7.1.2016 to the earlier notice dated 16.12.2016, the corrigendum notice was received by the counsel for the accused, even after receipt of the same, the accused failed to pay cheques amount. Hence, the complainant has filed a complaint against the accused for the offence punishable u/S 138 and 142 of N.I. Act. 3. On being satisfied with the material placed before it, the trial court has taken cognizance for the offence punishable u/S 138 of the N.I. Act, issued summons u/S 204 of Cr.P.C. In pursuance of the summons, the accused has appeared before the trial court, Crl.A. No.25086/2020 the trial court enlarged the accused on bail, thereafter, plea was recorded, the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 4. In order to prove his case the complainant was examined as P.W.1 and got marked Ex.P.1 to P.11, the learned counsel for the accused has cross-examined P.W.1. On 25.07.2019 statement of accused was recorded U/sec.313 of Cr.P.C. Thereafter, the accused was examined himself as D.W.1 and got marked Ex.D.1 to Ex.D.6 and D.W.1 was cross examined by the learned counsel for complainant.

Act. It is alleged in the complaint that, the accused is known to the complainant\n      and the accused had approached the complainant for financial help of Crl.A.\n      No.25086/2020 Rs.8,00,000/- for the purpose of construction of his house in first\n      week of October 2015, since the complainant knew that the accused was under need\n        of money, hence the complainant has paid hand loan of Rs.8,00,000/- to the accused\n      on 1st week of October 2015 by way of cash, at the time of taking loan the accused has\n      promised to repay the said hand loan within one year from the date of loan, after\n       completion of one year the complainant had demanded the accused for repayment of\n     hand loan of Rs.8,00,000/-, on repeated demand, the accused has issued two\n      cheques bearing No.066519, dated 7.11.2016 for sum of Rs.4,00,000/- and cheque\n      No.066520, dated 7.11.2016 for sum of Rs.4,00,000/-, both drawn on State Bank of\n       India, Mahadevapura Branch, Bangaluru, in favour of complainant towards payment\n       of hand loan, believing the words of the accused, the complainant has presented the\n       said cheques for encashment on 22.11.2016, but said cheques were returned with a\n      bank endorsement dated 22.11.2016 \"Account Closed\". Thereafter, the complainant\n       Crl.A. No.25086/2020 had approached the accused and brought the notice on\n      dishonour of cheque, but accused did not heed the request of the complainant, hence\n       the complainant got issued legal notice dated 16.12.2016 calling upon the accused to\n      pay the cheque amount within 15 days from the date of receipt of notice. Due to\n       typographical error it is mentioned in the notice as State Bank of Mysore instead of\n       State Bank of India, hence the complainant got issued corrigendum notice dated\n       7.1.2016 to the earlier notice dated 16.12.2016, the corrigendum notice was received\n      by the counsel for the accused, even after receipt of the same, the accused failed to\n      pay cheques amount. Hence, the complainant has filed a complaint against the\n       accused for the offence punishable u/S 138 and 142 of N.I. Act.\n\n3. On being satisfied with the material placed before it, the trial court has taken cognizance for the\noffence punishable u/S 138 of the N.I. Act, issued summons u/S 204 of Cr.P.C.

No.25086/2020 \"GROUNDS I. The impugned judgment and sentence passed\n      by the trial court is against the law and all probabilities of the case. The trial court has\n      wrongly come to conclusion that accused has committed offence u/S 138 of N.I. Act.\n\n         II. No opportunity was given to the accused to establish his defence and defence\n      taken by the accused was not considered. The trial court failed to consider the fact\n       that the complainant and accused have worked together in the company and they\n      were residing in a house together before the transaction in the year 2002 to 2010 and\n        after marriage he left the house of the complainant, at that time the accused has left\n      one petty box which was contained marriage invitation card, some clothes, passbook\n        of SBI, cheque book and photos and the trial court failed to consider the fact that the\n        Crl.A. No.25086/2020 complainant has misused the cheque left by the accused in the\n      house of complainant.\n\n\n       III.   The    trial          court    failed    to\n       consider          the        fact     that     the\n       appellant              has       denied        his\n\n       signature and contents of cheque.\n\n\n       IV.    The    trial      court        failed    to\n       consider          the        fact     that     the\n       complainant has got issued legal\n       notice       on    16.12.2016            to    the\n       appellant and the appellant has\n\n      given tenable reply, after receipt of the legal notice the respondent has given\n      corrigendum notice dated 7.1.2017. The said reply notice has not been marked by the\n       complainant.\n\n       V. The trial court failed to consider the contradiction and omission in the evidence of\n      complainant and come to wrong conclusion. Thus, the judgment and order of\n       conviction passed by the trial court is not sustainable under law and facts. With this,\n       the appellant prayed for allowing the appeal.\"\n\n        Crl.A. No.25086/2020\n\n5. On admitting the appeal, this court has passed the order, on the application filed by the appellant\nu/S 389 (1) of Cr.P.C., and suspended the operation and execution of the trial court order and issued\nnotice to the respondent.

On 6.7.1995 he had contacted the accused in his office and showed his\nrequirement of birth certificate of Sarpreet Singh, Ramanpreet Kaur and Amandeep Kaur and\nnephew Parminder Singh and he had deposited the requisite fee in that connection.

He had handed over 12 currency notes to him for laying trap upon him. DSP\nVigilance (PW8) recorded the statement (Ex.P7) and treated the currency notes MO2 to MO13 with\nphenolphthalein powder, prepared the memo of the currency notes and thereafter passed the same\nto the complainant with the direction that he would hand over the money to the accused on demand.\nBaldev Singh was appointed as shadow witness with the direction that he would hear the\nconversation between the complainant and the accused and after the tainted money is passed on to\nthe accused, he would give signal to him with his right hand. Kuldip Singh Work Munshi Public\nHealth Sub Division-I, Fatehgarh Sahib (PW7) was joined as independent witness. He was also\ninformed about the plan organized by the Investigating Officer. All these proceedings and trap\nproceedings were recorded vide endorsement Ex.PW7/A. On the basis of the ruqa sent to the Police\nstation formal FIR (Ex.P19) was recorded by Inspector Vigilance Hakumat Singh.\n\nAs per directions the complainant and the shadow witness Baldev Singh met the accused who\ndemanded Rs.1200/- for issuing four birth certificates as aforesaid, where upon the complainant\nhanded over the currency notes to the accused who put the same under the papers lying on the table.\nIn the meantime, on giving signal by the shadow witness, DSP Sukhdev Singh along with other\nmembers of the raiding party arrived there; caught hold the accused from his wrist. After giving him\nhis identity, DSP Sukhdev Singh called for a glass of water in which he put sodium carbonate but the\ncolour of the water did not change.

The seal was handed over to\nKuldip Singh Work Munshi and the nip was taken into possession vide memo Ex.P10.

On comparison of the currency notes so recovered from the accused tallied. As such,\nthe said currency notes were taken into possession vide memo Ex.P11. The complainant produced\nfour birth certificates which were also taken into possession as MO-14 to MO-17 vide memo Ex.P13.\nThe receipt book No.48570 (Ex.P4) which included four receipts vide which the complainant had\ndeposited the fee for four birth certificates was also produced by the accused and the same was\ntaken into possession vide memo Ex.P14. The application for taking birth certificates Ex.P15 was\nalso taken into possession. On personal search of the accused, a sum of Rs.286/- were recovered\nfrom his shirt pocket which were also taken into possession vide memo Ex.P12. Investigating Officer\nprepared the rough site plan Ex.P23 and on completion of the investigation challan against the\naccused was presented in the court.\n\nThe accused was charged under Section 7 read with Section 13 (2) of the Act, to which he pleaded\nnot guilty and opted to contest.\n\nIn order to substantiate the charges, the prosecution examined Karnail Singh (PW1), MHC\nGurcharan Singh (PW2), Bikramjit Mahajan (PW3), Talwinder Singh complainant (PW4), Baldev\nSingh (PW5), Raghbir Singh (PW6), Kuldip Singh (PW7), DSP Sukhwinder Singh (PW8) and C.\nHarminder Singh (PW9).\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36470968/                                                                 2                                  Kehar Singh vs State Of Punjab on 10 November, 2010\n\nWhen examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C. the accused while admitting that Talwinder Singh had\nmet him on 6.7.1995 when he had come to obtain birth certificates pertaining to Sarpreet Singh,\nRamanpreet Kaur, Amanpreet Kaur and Parminder Singh, denied all other allegations and pleaded\nhis false implication in the case. However, no evidence was led in defence.\n\nThe trial ended in conviction.\n\nArguments heard. Record perused.\n\nThe motive regarding demand of bribe money is writ large in the case. As a matter of fact, birth\nentries of Parminder Singh and Ramandeep Kaur were not recorded in the Birth and Death\nRegister. However, on the request of the complainant, the same were entered some time prior to\n6.7.1995 with late fee and permission by the competent authority. The fee receipt Ex.P28, letter\nEx.P25, applications Ex.P30 and P31, affidavit Ex.P32 regarding birth entry relating to Parminder\nSingh and letter Ex.P40 regarding late fee deposit receipt Ex.P39, letters Ex.P35 and Ex.P36\nregarding Ramanpreet Kaur and letters dated 6.7.1995 Ex.P24 regarding Parminder Singh, letter\ndated 6.7.1995 Ex.P25 regarding Amanpreet Kaur which were issued by the District Registrar, Births\nand Deaths, Fatehgarh Sahib to Local Registrar, Births & Deaths, Police Station Sirhind for sending\ntheir birth certificates duly exist in the record. After the application moved by the complainant to\nreceive the birth certificates of his niece and nephew also established that the complainant was in\nneed of the birth certificates and he had visited the office of Civil Surgeon in that connection. The\naccused has also admitted that the complainant had met him on 6.7.1995 in connection with the\nissuance of certificates and had also filed the application Ex.P34. The complainant, without mincing\nthe words, had stated that the accused had demanded Rs.1400/- from him on 6.7.1995 for issuing\nbirth certificates and again he visited the office on 11.7.1995 and he was not delivered the certificates\non that day also, indicate about the designs of the accused to issue certificates only on receipt of the\nbribe money. The complainant has been cross examined regarding demand of bribe who has\nwithstood the test. The argument raised by the learned counsel for the accused that mere ipsi dixit of\nthe complainant is not sufficient to prove the demand is without any merit. As a matter of fact, the\nbribe is always demanded in isolation and there could be no witness to the same, as such, it is only\nthe conduct of the complainant which the court could examine before reaching the conclusion if\nthere was any demand or not. As such, no corroborative evidence was required. The trial court has\nalso relied upon two judgments delivered in the cases of Rajinder Kumar Sood v. State of Punjab\n1983 Crl. L. J. 1338 and Ramesh Kumar Gupta v. State of M.P. 1995 Crl. L. J. 3656. In the latter\njudgment, it was observed that the court could act upon un-corroborated testimony of the trap\nwitness if it is satisfied from the facts and circumstances of the case that the witness is a witness of\ntruth.\n\nIt is often seen that bargaining qua passing of illegal gratification are made in the isolation,\ntherefore, no corroboration is required to the testimony of the complainant who makes categorical\nstatement that the accused had demanded the bribe. The other evidence and the evidence with\nregard to acceptance also proves the prior demand of the gratification. As such, no corroboration is\nrequired.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36470968/                                                                 3                                  Kehar Singh vs State Of Punjab on 10 November, 2010\n\nIn the instant case, the demand was made on 6.7.1995 and then on 11.7.1995, the bargain was se...",

The State Government is empowered under Section 432 of the Code of Criminal Procedure6 to\nsuspend or remit sentences. Sub-section (2) of Section 432 provides that the appropriate\ngovernment may take the opinion of the presiding judge of the court before or by which the person\nmaking an application for remission has been convicted on whether the application should be\nallowed or rejected, together with the reasons for such opinion. Sub-section (2) of Section 432 reads\nthus:\n\n       “Section 432- Power to suspend or remit sentences.\n\n      ….\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145418470/                                                                2                        Ram Chander vs The State Of Chhattisgarh on 22 April, 2022\n\n       (2) Whenever an application is made to the appropriate Government for the\n       suspension or remission of a sentence, the appropriate Government may require the\n       presiding Judge of the Court before or by which the conviction was had or confirmed,\n       to state his opinion as to whether the application should be granted or refused,\n       together with his reasons for such opinion and also to forward with the statement of\n      such 6 “CrPC” opinion a certified copy of the record of the trial or of such record\n       thereof as exists.\n\n….”\n\n5. Section 433-A of the CrPC lays down the restriction on powers of remission in the following\nterms:\n\n     “433A. Restriction on powers of remission or commutation in certain\n      cases.-Notwithstanding anything contained in section 432, where a sentence of\n      imprisonment for life is imposed on conviction of a person for an offence for which\n      death is one of the punishments provided by law, or where a sentence of death\n     imposed on a person has been commuted under section 433 into one of\n      imprisonment for life, such person shall not be released from prison unless he had\n       served at least fourteen years of imprisonment.”\n\n6. By a letter dated 1 May 2021, the Jail Superintendent of the Central Jail at Durg sought the\nopinion of the Special Judge, Durg on whether the petitioner can be released on remission. On 2\nJuly 2021, the Special Judge gave his opinion that in view of all the facts and circumstances of the\ncase, it would not be appropriate to allow remission of the remaining sentence of the petitioner. The\nrelevant portions of the letter containing the opinion of the Special Judge are reproduced below:\n\n      “Perused the documents filed alongwith the present application. Perused the\n      judgement dated 07.12.2010 passed in Special Case No. 16/2006 \"State Vs. Anil &\n       Ors.\" under Section 147, 148, 302/ 149, 302/ 149, 307/149 and 3 (2) (5) Scheduled\n       Caste Schedule Tribe, (Prevention of Corruption) Act. Accused Ramchander son of\n      Khajaan Singh alongwith 8 other co-accused persons has assembled against the law\n      and by using deadly weapons sword, axe, wooden stick (Danda), has killed Kartikram\n      and Puneet, in relation to this case the accused is undergoing imprisonment.\n\n      Then in this situation keeping in view all the facts and circumstances, it does not\n      seem appropriate to allow remission of the remaining sentence of the above prisoner,\n       therefore not recommending for the same.”\n\n7. The application for remission of the petitioner, along with the opinion of the Special Judge, was\nforwarded to the Director General, Jail and Correctional services. On 30 September 2021, the\nDirector General presented the case of the petitioner to the Home Department, Government of\nChhattisgarh by a letter addressed to the Additional Chief Secretary, Jail Department. Thereafter,\nthe Jail Department in a note sheet dated 6 October 2021 forwarded the case of the petitioner to the\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145418470/                                                                3                        Ram Chander vs The State Of Chhattisgarh on 22 April, 2022\n\nLaw Department of the State Government. The Under Secretary of the Law Department shared his\nopinion through a note sheet dated 27 November 2021 stating that the petitioner cannot be given\nthe benefit of the provisions of Section 433-A CrPC because the presiding judge opined against\nreleasing the petitioner on remission.\n\n8. On 2 March 2022. the Director General, Jail and Correctional Services again forwarded the case\nof the petitioner to the Additional Chief Secretary, Jail Department to be considered for remission\nsince the petitioner had completed 20 years of imprisonment with remission. The Jail Department\nsought the opinion of the Law Department, which stated that since the presiding judge of the\nsentencing court has not given a positive opinion with regard to the release of the petitioner, he\ncannot be released.\n\nSubmissions of Counsel\n\n9. Mr MD Irshad Hanif, counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, made the following\nsubmissions:\n\n         (i) A convict-prisoner can be considered for pre-mature release under Section 433-A\n        of the CrPC after the completion of 14 years even without the consent of the presiding\n       judge of the sentencing court;\n\n         (ii) Under Section 432 (2) of the CrPC, the appropriate Government has the\n       discretion to seek the opinion of the presiding judge of the sentencing court;\n\n          (iii) There is absence of ...",

    "facts_of_case": "of the case cited supra. Hence the above two decisions will no way improve the case of the petitioner. 23 The learned counsel for the petitioner also placed reliance on the ratio laid down in R.Balakrishna Pillai v. State of Kerala . This decision deals with the scope of Section 197(1) Cr.P.C. but not Section 19 of the P.C. Act. 24 The learned counsel for the petitioner further placed reliance on V.Suryanarayana Case cited supra, wherein a learned single Judge of this Court held that sanction is necessary to prosecute even a retired government employee basing on G.Sagar Suri vs. State of U.P. and Prakash Singh Badal vs. State of Punjab . G.Sagar Suri Case is not arising out of the provisions of the P.C. Act. As per the principle enunciated by the Honble apex Court in Prakash Singh Badal case, no sanction is necessary if the public servant in question had ceased to be a public servant as on the date of taking of cognizance. In Ajoy Acharya v. State Bureau of Investigation against Economic Offences , the Honble apex Court after referring the decisions in R.S. Naik v A.R.Antulay and Prakash Singh Badal Case, at para No.14 (Manupatra) held as follows: 14. The judgments referred to in paragraph 13 above, were relied upon by the Courts below to reject the contention advanced at the hands of the Appellant, that sanction was essential before the Appellant could be prosecuted. It would be pertinent to mention, that extracts from the judgments referred to in paragraph 13 reproduced above, deal with two pointed situations. Firstly, whether sanction before prosecution is required from each of the competent authorities entitled to remove an accused from the offices held by him, in situations wherein the accused holds a plurality of offices. The second determination was in respect of the requirement of sanction, in situations where the accused no longer holds the office, which he is alleged to have abused/misused, for committing the offence(s) for which he is being blamed. In answer to the first query, it has unambiguously been concluded, that if an accused holds a plurality of offices, each one of which makes him a public servant, sanction is essential only at the hands of the competent authority (entitled to remove him from service) of the office which he had allegedly misused. This leads to the clear inference, that other public offices held by the accused wherein an accused holds a plurality of offices, are irrelevant for purposes of obtaining sanction prior to prosecution. On the second issue it was concluded, that sanction was essential only if, at the time of taking cognizance, the accused was still holding the public office which Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89240281/ 13 Buddi Chandra Mohan, S/O.Late ... vs Counsel For The on 30 January, 2017 he had allegedly abused.

SUNIL CHOWDARY\n       CRIMINAL PETITION No.16208 OF 2014\n       ORDER:\n\nThis petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C seeking to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.69 of\n2013 on the file of the Special Court for trial of ACB cases in Rayalaseema Region, Kurnool.\n\n2 The facts leading to the filing of the present petition are, briefly, as follows:\n\n      The petitioner joined the Government service on 05.12.1978 as Probationary Deputy\n       Tahsildar and got promotions from time to time. The petitioner worked as Special\n     Grade Deputy Collector, Srisailam Project with effect from 01.03.2009 to\n      28.10.2009. The petitioner retired from service on attaining the age of\n      superannuation on 31.12.2010. On receiving credible information, that the petitioner\n      has acquired disproportionate assets, while functioning as a public servant, the\n       Inspector of Police, ACB registered a case in Crime No.11/RCA-KUR/2009 dated\n       21.11.2012, against the petitioner, for the offences punishable under Sections 13 (2)\n      r/w 13 (1) (e) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (the P.C.Act). After completion of\n       investigation, the Investigating Officer laid charge sheet on 12.11.2013 against the\n       petitioner for the aforesaid offences. The learned Special Judge has taken cognizance\n        of the offences under Sections 13 (2) r/w 13 (1)\n\n        (e) of the P.C.Act and numbered the same as C.C.No.69 of 2013.\n\nAs per the allegations made in the charge sheet, the petitioner has acquired disproportionate assets\nworth of Rs.1,18,11,883/- to the known sources of his income.\n\n3 The first and foremost contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that this court can\nquash the criminal proceedings at any stage. On the other hand, the learned standing counsel for the\nrespondent ACB contended that the trial was commenced and as many as 88 witnesses were\nexamined on behalf of the prosecution and hence this is not the stage to quash the proceedings\nagainst the petitioner.\n\n4 To substantiate the argument, the learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn the attention of\nthis Court to the following decisions.\n\nSatish Mehra vs. State (NCT of Delhi) & Another wherein the Honble apex Court at Para No.14 held\nas follows:\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89240281/                                                                 2                          Buddi Chandra Mohan, S/O.Late ... vs Counsel For The on 30 January, 2017\n\n        14. The power to interdict a proceeding either at the threshold or at an intermediate\n       stage of the trial is inherent in a High Court on the broad principle that in case the\n       allegations made in the FIR or the criminal complaint, as may be, prima facie do not\n       disclose a triable offence, there can be reason as to why the accused should be made\n       to suffer the agony of a legal proceeding that more often than not gets protracted. A\n       prosecution which is bound to become lame or a sham ought to be interdicted in the\n        interest of justice as continuance thereof will amount to an abuse of the process of the\n       law. This is the core basis on which the power to interfere with a pending criminal\n       proceeding has been recognised to be inherent in every High Court.\n\nRajiv Thapar vs. Madan Lal Kapoor wherein the Honble apex Court at Para No.30 held as follows:\n\n       30. Based on the factors canvassed in the foregoing paragraphs, we would delineate\n       the following steps to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashment raised by an\n       accused by invoking the power vested in the High Court under Section 482 CrPC:\n\n        30.1. Step one: whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, reasonable,\n      and indubitable i.e. the material is of sterling and impeccable quality?\n\n       30.2. Step two: whether the material relied upon by the accused would rule out the\n       assertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused i.e. the material is\n        sufficient to reject and overrule the factual assertions contained in the complaint i.e.\n       the material is such as would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn\n       the factual basis of the accusations as false?\n\n       30.3. Step three: whether the material relied upon by the accused has not been\n       refuted by the prosecution/complainant;\n\nand/or the material is such that it cannot be justifiably refuted by the prosecution/complainant?\n\n30.4. Step four: whether proceeding with the trial would result in an abuse of process of the court,\nand would not serve the ends of justice?\n\n30.5. If the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative, the judicial conscience of the High Court\nshould persuade it to quash such criminal proceedings in exercise of power vested in it under\nSection 482 CrPC. Such exercise of power, besides doing justice to the accused, would save precious\ncourt time, which would otherwise be wasted in holding such a trial (as well as proceedings arising\ntherefrom) specially when it is clear that the same would not conclude in the conviction of the\naccused. As per the principle enunciated in the above cited cases, High Court, at any stage, can\nquash the proceedings against the accused if the material produced by him clearly rules out the\nallegations made against him and such allegations would not end in conviction. The Honble apex\nCourt reiterated and reaffirmed the principle enunciated in the cases cited supra in Prashant Bharti\nvs. State (NCT of Delhi) and Umesh Kumar vs. State of Andhra Pradesh .\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89240281/                                                                 3                          Buddi Chandra Mohan, S/O.Late ... vs Counsel For The on 30 January, 2017\n\n5 On the other hand, the learned standing counsel for the ACB has drawn the attention of this Court\nto the ratio laid down in G.Sagar Suri vs. State of U.P wherein the Honble apex Court at para No.9\nheld as follows:\n\n        9. In State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy {(1977) 2 SCC 699} this Court said that in\n       the exercise of the wholesome power under Section 482 of the Code the High Court is\n       entitled to quash a proceeding if it comes to the conclusion that allowing the\n       proceeding to continue would be an abuse of the process of the court or that the ends\n        of justice require that the proceedings are to be quashed.\n\nAs per the principle enunciated in the case cited supra, this Court can quash the criminal\nproceedings by exercising inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to prevent abuse of\nprocess of law and thereby to secure the ends of justice. Having regard to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case and also the principle enunciated in the cases cited supra, I am unable to\naccede to the contention of the learned standing counsel that the present petition is liable to be\ndismissed in limine in view of commencement of trial.\n\n6 The second contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that Inspector of Police is not\nentitled to investigate into the offence punishable under Section 13(e) of the P.C. Act. He further\nsubmitted that the investigating officer who was working as Sub-Inspector of Police was officiated as\nInspector of Police and hence on that ground also the investigation conducted by the investigating\nofficer is not legally sustainable. In such circumstances, forcing the petitioner to face the rigour of\ncriminal trial is nothing short of abuse of process of law. 7 On the other hand, the learned standing\ncounsel for the ACB submitted that there is no bar to investigate into the matter by the Inspector of\nPolice in view of the provisions of the P.C. Act. To substantiate the argument, the learned counsel for\nthe petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to the ratio laid down in V.Suryanarayana vs.\nState wherein this Court at Para No.17 held as follows:\n\n        17. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner placed reliance upon Section 17(c)\n        of the P.C.Act which contemplates that a Deputy Superintendent of Police or a P...",

The present Petitioner, who is in custody since 12.01.2021, has filed the instant bail application\nunder Section 439 of Cr.P.C. corresponding to 2(C)CC Case No.51 of 2020 pending in the court of\nthe Learned S.D.J.M., Panposh, Rourkela for commission of offences under Sections 132(1)(C) and\n132(1)(b) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \"the CGST Act,\n2017\" for brevity). Prior to the instant application, the Petitioner had approached the learned 1st\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Rourkela, for Bail, but it was rejected vide order dated 28.07.2021.\n\n2. Shorn of unnecessary details, the prosecution's case is that after a search enquiry conducted on\nM/S Pacific Packing Industries, it was found that the firm of the petitioner namely, M/S Sony Iron\nand Steel Trading Co.\n\nwas engaged in availing fraudulent ITC from the sham subsidiaries of M/S Pacific Packing\nIndustries.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/100530341/                                                                1                                    Ajaj Ahamad vs State Of Odisha (Cgst) .... Opp. Party on 4 April, 2022\n\nFurthermore, ITC benefits to the tune of Rs.5,02,21,055 were acquired by the petitioner's firm and\nM/S Harihara Enterprises, by way of fake bills without the actual supply of goods.\n\n3. Per contra, the learned counsel for the Petitioner earnestly submitted that the allegations made\nagainst the Petitioner in the prosecution report are bald allegations which lack the backing of any\nsubstantial evidence. It was contended that the Petitioner was held responsible for availing a total\nGST amount to the tune of Rs. 5, 02, 21, 055 against M/S Sony Iron and Steel Trading Co and M/S\nHarihara Enterprises. However, the petitioner is the proprietor of only the former company and the\nlater is under the proprietorship of Dhanjaya Suna. The petitioner has been arrayed as an accused\nfor the acts and omission of M/S Harihara Enterprises as well, but solely on the basis of his own\nconfession. Law is well settled that the confession of the accused cannot be used against him. It has\nbeen submitted that the investigation/enquiry officer has wrongly calculated that date sheet details\nand has thereby, erred in indicating the misappropriated tax amount above the margin of Rs.5\ncrores. Further, the payment of tax to the tune of Rs.19,29,972 by the petitioner has been overlooked\nby the investigating officer.\n\nIt is submitted that the Petitioner has been duly cooperating with the authorities and has on\nmultiple occasions appeared in the offices to assist the authorities with the investigation, but despite\nhis bonafide actions, he was forwarded into custody on 12.01.2021. The Petitioner's family is on the\nbrink of starvation due to his absence.\n\nFurthermore, the final charge sheet has been submitted and the documentary evidences have been\nseized, leaving no scope for the tampering of evidence. Learned counsel for the Petitioner finally\nurged that there is no risk of the Petitioner fleeing since he resides locally and he should be released\non bail as the trial has not commenced and the petitioner has been advised by the doctor to undergo\na bypass surgery.\n\n4. Heard learned counsel for both parties and perused the records.\n\n5. The core concept and philosophy of bail was discussed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Vaman\nNarain Ghiya v. State of Rajasthan1, wherein it was observed that:\n\n\"6. 'Bail' remains an undefined term in CrPC. Nowhere else has the term been statutorily defined.\nConceptually, it continues to be understood as a right for assertion of freedom against the State\nimposing restraints. Since the UN Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, to which India is a\nsignatory, the concept of bail has found a place within the scope of human rights. The dictionary\nmeaning of the expression 'bail' denotes a security for appearance of a prisoner for his release.\nEtymologically, the word is derived from an old French verb 'bailer' which means to 'give' or 'to\ndeliver', although another view is that its derivation is from the Latin term 'baiulare', meaning 'to\nbear a burden'. Bail is a conditional liberty. Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (4th Edn., 1971) spells out\ncertain other details. It states:\n\n            '... when a man is taken or arrested for felony, suspicion of felony, indicted of felony,\n       or any such case, so that he is restrained of his liberty. And, being by law bailable,\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/100530341/                                                                2                                    Ajaj Ahamad vs State Of Odisha (Cgst) .... Opp. Party on 4 April, 2022\n\n       offereth surety to those which have authority to bail him, which sureties are bound\n        for him to the King's use in a certain sums of money, or body for body, (2009) 2 SCC\n      281 that he shall appear before the justices of goal delivery at the next sessions, etc.\n      Then upon the bonds of these sureties, as is aforesaid, he is bailed--that is to say, set\n        at liberty until the day appointed for his appearance.' Bail may thus be regarded as a\n     mechanism whereby the State devolutes upon the community the function of\n       securing the presence of the prisoners, and at the same time involves participation of\n       the community in administration of justice.\n\n7. Personal liberty is fundamental and can be circumscribed only by some process sanctioned by\nlaw. Liberty of a citizen is undoubtedly important but this is to balance with the security of the\ncommunity. A balance is required to be maintained between the personal liberty of the accused and\nthe investigational right of the police. It must result in minimum interference with the personal\nliberty of the accused and the right of the police to investigate the case. It has to dovetail two\nconflicting demands, namely, on the one hand the requirements of the society for being shielded\nfrom the hazards of being exposed to the misadventures of a person alleged to have committed a\ncrime; and on the other, the fundamental canon of criminal jurisprudence viz. the presumption of\ninnocence of an accused till he is found guilty. Liberty exists in proportion to wholesome restraint,\nthe more restraint on others to keep off from us, the more liberty we have. (See A.K. Gopalan v.\nState of Madras [AIR 1950 SC 27).\n\n8. The law of bail, like any other branch of law, has its own philosophy, and occupies an important\nplace in the administration of justice and the concept of bail emerges from the conflict between the\npolice power to restrict liberty of a man who is alleged to have committed a crime, and presumption\nof innocence in favour of the alleged criminal. An accused is not detained in custody with the object\nof punishing him on the assumption of his guilt.\"\n\n6. In Moti Ram v. State of M.P.2 the Hon'ble Supreme Court, while discussing pretrial detention,\nheld:\n\n        \"14. The consequences of pretrial detention are grave. Defendants presumed innocent\n       are subjected to the psychological and physical deprivations of jail life, usually under\n     more onerous conditions than are imposed on convicted defendants. The jailed\n      defendant loses his job if he has one and is prevented from contributing to the\n       preparation of his defence. Equally important, the burden of his detention frequently\n         falls heavily on the innocent members of his family.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sanjay Chandra v. CBI3 , dealing with a case involving\nan economic offence of formidable magnitude, touching upon the issue of grant of bail, had\nobserved that deprivation of liberty must be considered a punishment unless it is required to ensure\nthat an accused person would stand his trial when called upon. The courts owe more than verbal\nrespect to the principle that punishment begins after conviction and that every man is deemed to be\ninnocent until duly tried and found guilty. It was underlined that the object of bail is\njurisprudentially neither punitive nor preventive. Although the Hon'ble Supreme Court sounded a\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/100530341/                                                                3                                    Ajaj Ahamad vs State Of Odisha (Cgst) ....

On the intervening night of 15/16.11.1991, at about 9.00 p.m.\n        after returning from work, Isham Singh told Kundan Lal that he was to go to bring\n       his wife in the following morning from her parental house at Ladwa, therefore, he\n      needed a new shirt which he had given for stitching to Sukhbir Singh. Consequently,\n      he went to the house of Sukhbir Singh for the said purpose. After about 45 minutes,\n      on hearing the cries from the side of the house of Sukhbir Singh, Kundan Lal and his\n       wife Krishna went running and saw that Tara Chand and his son Surinder Singh\n      armed with lathi and Raghbir Singh and Dharambir sons of Chandgi empty handed\n      were fighting with Isham Singh; abusing them for usurping the whole land and\n       depriving them of their share. At this, Tara Chand exhorted Surinder Singh \"maar\n       saley ko lathi, yeh zameen ka hissa nahin deta\". At this, his wife Krishna, Sukhbir\n      Singh and his wife Biro tried to intervene. However, Surinder Singh inflicted a lathi\n      blow on the head of Isham Singh. Tara Chand gave one injury to Kundan Lal so also\n      Raghbir Singh gave fist blows on his nose. Isham Singh fell down, whereupon,\n      complainant Kundan Lal (herein Crl. Appeal No. 2-SB of 2000 & referred as 'the\n       complainant'), his wife Krishna, Sukhbir Singh and Biro lay over Isham Singh in\n      order to save him. The accused caused injuries to them also and left the place.\n       Thereafter, the injured Isham Singh and Kundan Lal were shifted to hospital. The\n       doctor sent ruqa pursuant to which SI Bansi Lal went to the Civil Hospital and moved\n       application Ex.PH on 16.11.1991 at about 8.45 a.m. whereupon vide report Ex.PH/2,\n       the doctor opined that Isham Singh was unfit to make statement. As such, at 9.00\n       a.m. SI Bansi (PW9) without wasting any further time, recorded statement of Kundan\n       Lal Ex.PN/1, on the basis of which FIR Ex.PN/3 was recorded at Police Station,\n      Batana on 16.11.1991 at about 11.15 a.m. which was completed at 11.45 a.m. Kundan\n       Lal produced blood stained shirt Ex.P7, chadara Ex.P8 before SI Bansi Lal which was\n       taken into possession vide memo Ex.PO.\n\nHowever, when Investigating Officer SI Bansi Lal was on his way to the place of occurrence, then he\nwas informed that Isham Singh had died, therefore, he came back and handed over the investigation\nto SI/SHO. SI/SHO Sohan Lal prepared the inquest report Ex.PL/3, moved application Ex.PL/2 for\npostmortem examination. Dr. S.R. Ajmani (PW4) conducted the postmortem examination and\nsubmitted report Ex.PL. He also took into possession the clothes of Isham Singh vide recovery\nmemo Ex.PR. The accused were arrested. Surinder Singh pursuant to his disclosure statement\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93681417/                                                                 2                                  Surinder Singh And Others vs State Of Haryana on 16 July, 2010\n\nEx.PR/1 got recovered the lathi vide memo Ex.PR/2. He also got recovered another lathi from Tara\nChand pursuant to the disclosure statement Ex.PS. While being shown to the doctor, he opined vide\nopinion Ex.PM/K that the injury on the person of Isham Singh could be the result of lathi blow.\nVarious other articles were also taken into possession. On completion of the investigation, the\naccused were challaned.\n\nIt would be pertinent to mention here that Surinder Singh moved an application claiming himself to\nbe juvenile, but, vide order dated 24.9.1993, his that request was declined. As such, he as well as\nTara Chand were charged under Sections 304/325 read with Section 34 IPC, whereas, accused\nRaghbir Singh was charged under Section 325 read with Section 34 IPC. However, they pleaded not\nguilty and opted to contest.\n\nIn order to substantiate the charges, the prosecution examined Dr. G.S. Arora (PW1) who x-rayed\nthe injuries on the person of Kundan Lal Crl. Appeal No. 2-SB of 2000 & and found fracture on the\nparietal bone.

    "facts_of_case": "of the given case. A false statement given before the Court on oath strikes at the very root of the Criminal Justice System. A Court cannot ignore such a conduct which has the propensity to shake the public confidence in Judicial Institutions. If the Courts become lackadaisical in dealing with false statements given by witnesses on oath, it will virtually dislodge the administration of justice and the dignity of the Court. Hence, apart from the alternative remedy of proceeding against the witness for perjury, it is always open to the Higher Courts to initiate contempt proceedings to ensure that the administration of justice remains unpolluted due to false evidence being tendered before the temple of justice. 16.In many important cases where serious crimes are committed, the Courts are virtually made https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.A.(MD).Nos.228,230,232,233,515,536&747 of 2022 to render acquittal to the accused persons in a platter since every other witness turns around and becomes hostile. The Courts are bound by the procedure that is prescribed by Law and the Courts cannot write judgment based on emotions. Hence, in a criminal case, proving the case beyond reasonable doubt continues to be the test. In order to ensure that the witnesses do not turn around before the Court, there are a few cases where the prosecution takes the effort of recording the statement of witnesses on oath before the Magistrate under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. This is done with the fond hope Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/57531294/ 97 Yuvaraj vs State Rep. By on 2 June, 2023 that witnesses will stand by what they said before the Magistrate. We have to hasten and state that it is not necessary for the witnesses to make the very same statement before the Court at the time of taking evidence and in such circumstances, it is the duty of the witness to state before the Court as to why the witness is retracting from the statement that was made on oath before the Magistrate under",

It focuses our attention to the\nugly facets of our society; the caste system, bigotry, inhuman treatment of persons belonging to the\nm a r g i n a l i s e d  s e c t i o n ,  e t  a l . h t t p s : / / w w w . m h c . t n . g o v . i n / j u d i s\nCrl.A.(MD).Nos.228,230,232,233,515,536&747 of 2022 En-route, this Court is confronted with the\nnow familiar scourge of witnesses conveniently turning hostile in a deliberate bid to derail and\ndeflect the course of justice.

These factors\nundoubtedly cast an additional burden on the judges who are tasked with the duty of deciding this\ncase. Despite such pressures, the judges must rise to meet these challenges and ultimately render\njustice within the parameters of the law.\n\nII. THE APPEALS\n\n3.There are seven appeals before us.

Sandeep Kumar, JT\n      2011 (3) SC 484.\n\n2. The issue raised in the present O.A. has been addressed and dealt with in detail in an order passed\nby this Tribunal in Shri Pappu Lal Meena v. The Commissioner of Police & another\n(O.A.No.1750/2011 with connected O.As.) decided on 17.5.2012. The relevant excerpt of the said\norder reads as under:-\n\n›. In view of the facts and circumstances involved in aforementioned cases and rival contentions\nparties, following common proposition arises to be determined by us.\n\n          (i). Whether a person implicated in a criminal case can be considered unsuitable for\n        his appointment in Delhi Police even after his acquittal in the same.\n\n          (ii). Whether Screening Committee constituted by Commissioner of Police, Delhi can\n       re assess/ evaluate the judgment of competent Court of jurisdiction passed by it\n       acquitting a person in criminal case, while assessing suitability of such person for\n      appointment in Delhi Police.\n\n          (iii). Whether a person who is convicted in criminal case on the plea of guilt can be\n       considered by Screening Committee as suitable for appointment in Delhi police on\n       the ground that the offences alleged to have been committed by him is mild and he is\n       convicted on plea bargain.\n\n4. As far as first proposition is concerned in terms of Section 248-A of Crl. Procedure (Conclusion of\ntrial of warrant cases by Magistrate) if in any case in which charges could be framed, the Magistrate\nfinds the accused not guilty, he should record an order of acquittal. Similarly in trial of summon\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13416320/                                                                 2                                      Shri Sandeep vs Commissioner Of Police on 13 March, 2013\n\ncases by Magistrate, in terms of Section 255 of Code of Criminal Procedure if the Magistrate, upon\ntaking the evidence referred to in Section 254 and such further evidence, if any, as he may, of his\nown motion, cause to be produced, finds the accused not guilty, he shall record an order of acquittal.\nIn terms of Section 232 of Cr. PC in case of trial before a court of session, if after taking the evidence\nfor the prosecution, examining the accused and hearing the prosecution and defence on the point,\nthe Judge considers that there is no evidence that the accused committed the offence, the Judge\nshall record an order of acquittal. From the language of aforementioned provision of Cr.PC it is\napparent that once a person implicated in a criminal case is acquitted, presumption is that after\ntaking the evidence for the prosecution, examining the accused and hearing the prosecution as well\nas defence on the point the concerned Judge could not find any evidence to the effect that the\naccused committed an offence, or the Magistrate has found that the accused is not guilty. In case of\ntrial of summon cases by Magistrate, acquittal is recorded upon taking the evidence referred to in\nSection 254 and other evidence caused to be produced and in case of acquittal in case of trial of\nwarrant cases by Magistrate, order of acquittal is recorded if the Magistrate find the accused not\nguilty. However, presumption is that such order is recorded after assessment of evidence placed on\nrecord under Sections 242, 243, 244 and 247 of the Code. These are Sections 232, 248, 250 and 255\nof Code of Criminal Procedure, in terms of which order of acquittal is recorded. Section 320 of Code\nof Criminal Procedure provide for compounding of certain offences mentioned in the table\nthereunder. In terms of Section 321 of Code of Criminal Procedure, the Public Prosecutor or\nAssistant Public Prosecutor in charge of any case may, with the consent of the Court, at any time\nbefore the judgment is pronounced, withdraw from the prosecution any person either generally or in\nrespect of any one or more of the offences for which he is tried; and, upon such withdrawal if same is\nafter framing the charge, he shall be treated as acquitted. Thus Section 321 (b) talks of acquittal on\nwithdrawal from prosecution but not of recording of an order of acquittal. In other words, even an\norder of acquittal as a result of steps taken by Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor\nunder Section 321 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 would be recorded under either of\naforementioned Sections, i.e. 232, 248 or 255 of Code of Criminal Procedure whereunder acquittal is\nrecorded only on satisfaction of finding of the Magistrate that the person is not guilty of\nallegation/charges framed against him. In terms of Section 306 of Cr.PC with a view to obtain the\nevidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an\noffence to which said section apply, the Chief Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate at\nany stage of the investigation or inquiry or trial of the offence, and the Magistrate of the first class\ninquiring into or trying the offence at any stage or trial may tender a pardon to such person on\ncondition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within his\nknowledge related to the offence and to every other person concerned, whether as principal or\nabettor, in the commission thereof. However, if the person so pardoned does not comply with the\ncondition of pardon in terms of Section 308 of Cr.PC, he may be tried for the offence in respect of\nwhich the pardon was tendered or for any offence of which he appears to have been guilty in\nconnection with the same matter and also for the offence of giving false evidence. Section 353 of\nCode of Criminal Procedure provide that the judgment in every trial in any criminal court of original\njurisdiction shall be pronounced in open Court by the Presiding Officer immediately after the\ntermination of trial or at some subsequent stage of which notice shall be given to the parties or their\npleaders:-\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13416320/                                                                 3                                      Shri Sandeep vs Commissioner Of Police on 13 March, 2013\n\n        (a) by delivering the whole of the judgment or\n\n       (b) by reading out the whole of the judgment; or\n\n        (c) by reading out the operative part of the judgment and explaining the substance of\n       the judgment in a language which is understood by the accused or the pleader.

Mr.K.Jeganathan\n       ^For Respondent  ...  Mr.R.Ganesan\n\n\n       :JUDGMENT\n\nThis criminal appeal has been filed by the appellant / complainant against the Judgment, dated\n29.05.2009 made in S.T.C.No.846 of 2005 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate No.VI, Madurai.\n\n2. It is an admitted fact that the case was taken on file on the complaint given by the appellant\nherein under Section138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, on the ground that the cheque, dated\n31.03.2005 issued by the respondent herein for an amount of Rs.1,81,800/- drawn on Karur Vysya\nBank for the consideration received, was dishonoured by the bank, while the same was presented for\npayment due to insufficient funds.\n\n3. According to the appellant, after the cheque was dishonoured by the bank, legal notice, dated\n16.04.2005 was issued by the appellant herein by Registered post. Having received the same, the\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1013116/                                                                  1                                      M.Vairavan vs T.M.Selvaraj on 3 December, 2010\n\nrespondent / accused had not chosen to send his reply and the cheque amount was also not paid,\nhence, the case was filed by the appellant before the court below under Section 138 of Negotiable\nInstruments Act, however, the court below without appreciating the evidence, according to law,\nrecorded acquittal. Aggrieved by which, this appeal has been preferred by the complainant.\n\n4. It is seen that on the side of the appellant, he himself was examined as P.W.1 and Exs.P.1 to P.5\nwere marked and the respondent / accused examined D.Ws. 1 to 3 and marked Exs.D.1 and D.2.\nConsidering the evidence, the Court below recorded acquittal, by way of the impugned Judgment.\n\n5. Mr.K.Jeganathan, learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that it has been\nestablished beyond reasonable doubt that the cheque was issued by the respondent / accused for\nvaluable consideration and the same was dishonoured only due to insufficient funds. Inspite of\nservice of legal notice to the respondent / accused, there was no reply from him, however, the\nrespondent / accused raised a defence, stating that the cheque was issued towards business\ntransaction with the son of the appellant and that the same was discharged. When discharge is\npleaded by the respondent admitting the issuance of the cheque, the burden is upon the respondent\n/ accused to establish the defence that he had discharged the debt by repaying the amount due and\npayable under the cheque.\n\n6. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant has not disputed the fact that there was business\ndealings between the respondent / accused and the son of the appellant, however, according to him,\nthat is nothing to do with the amount due and payable to the appellant, as per the cheque issued by\nthe respondent / accused in favour of the appellant herein. He has also drew the attention of this\ncourt to the defence documents marked as Exs.D.1 and D.2, relating to the year 2004. The cheque,\nEx.P.1 was issued for the consideration received in favour of the appellant / complainant, only on\n31.03.2005 and the cheque was bounced as per the endorsement dated 04.04.2005 made by the\nIndian Bank, Pudur Branch, Madurai and therefore, the defence raised by the respondent / accused\nis not legally sustainable. Had the defence raised by the respondent / accused been true, at least\nafter receipt of the legal notice, he could have sent his reply by raising the alleged defence of\ndischarge and therefore, the defence raised by the respondent / accused is only an after thought and\nlegally not sustainable.\n\n7. Per contra, Mr.R.Ganesan, learned counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that the\nrespondent had business dealings only with the son of the appellant and the cheque was issued in\nfavour of the appellant, for the amount due and payable to his son and therefore, the discharge\npleaded by the respondent has been established and accordingly, the court below has recorded\nacquittal.\n\n8. As per the evidence of the appellant, who was examined as P.W.1, the respondent / accused was\nknown to him through his son and he paid a sum of Rs.2,00,000 in the year 2003 July. After he\nrepaid some amount towards the loan, the balance payable was Rs.1,81,800/-. When the appellant /\nP.W.1 demanded the amount, the respondent / accused issued the cheque, dated 31.03.2005 drawn\non Karur Vysya Bank for the aforesaid amount, when the same was sent for collection through\nIndian Bank by the appellant, that was bounced with an endorsement, dated 04.05.2003 by the\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1013116/                                                                  2                                      M.Vairavan vs T.M.Selvaraj on 3 December, 2010\n\nBank. Ex.P.1 is the memo issued by the bank for deducting Rs.293/- in the account of the appellant\non account of the dishonour of the cheque, subsequently, the appellant issued legal notice, dated\n16.04.2005, the copy of the same was marked as Ex.P.4 before the court below. The respondent /\naccused received the notice on 26.04.2005, for which postal acknowledgement, Ex.P.5 has been\nmarked. The respondent / accused has not disputed the fact that the legal notice was served on him\nand that there was no reply sent by him. There is no satisfactory explanation on the side of the\nrespondent / accused for not sending his reply, despite the fact that he had received the legal notice\nsent by the appellant.\n\n9. On the side of the respondent / accused, three witnesses have been examined, however, the\nrespondent / accused has not chosen to exam himself as a witness for the reasons best known to\nhim. It is seen that on summon, wife of the appellant was examined on the side of the respondent /\naccused as D.W.3. As per the evidence of D.W.3, in the year 2003, her husband had paid a sum of\nRs.2 lakhs to the respondent / accused as a hand loan, subsequently, for the balance amount due\nand payable towards the loan, the respondent / accused gave a cheque, dated 31.03.2005 and\naccording to him a sum of Rs.18,200/- was paid by the respondent / accused to her son. She has also\nadduced hearsey evidence, that was also recorded by the court below. Though D.W.3 is admittedly\nthe wife of the appellant, she has to be construed as a third party to the cheque transaction. In her\nevidence, she has stated that the appellant was running a business in the name of Srinivasa Oil and\nSpares, but she did not know the address of the business. Merely because D.W.3 is the wife of the\nappellant, her self contradictory evidence cannot be a proof for discharge pleaded by the respondent\n/ accused.\n\n10. It is pertinent to note that the respondent / accused has not stated that the cheque issued by him\nwas a signed blank cheque by way of sending his reply notice or by examining himself as defence\nwitness. Therefore, it is not the case of the respondent that it was a blank cheque, later on filled up\nby the appellant / complainant. When the respondent / accused has admitted the signature available\nin the cheque, the burden is upon the respondent / accused to adduce rebuttal evidence, in view of\nthe presumption under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, which reads as follows :\n\n       \"139. Presumption in favour of holder - It shall be presumed, unless the contrary is\n       proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque, of the nature referred to in\n       section 138, for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability.\"\n\n11. In the instant case, the respondent / accused has not adduced any rebuttal evidence to establish\nthat the cheque was only a blank signed cheque handed over by him to the son of the appellant.\nWithout specific pleadings, the respondent / accused cannot adduce rebuttal evidence, by way of\nexamining some other witnesses, who are not competent to say whether it was a signed blank\ncheque or otherwise.\n\n12. It is seen that D.W.1 was the Assistant, working in ICICI Bank, K.K.Nagar. Since the Manager\nwas on leave, he was adducing evidence. According to him, the respondent / accused, T.M.Selvaraj\nhad account in the bank and that as per the account copy for the period between 01.07.2004 and\n27.07.2004, an amount of Rs.2 lakhs was paid to one Srinivasan on 09.07.2004.

Being aggrieved by the\nsame, the appellant-complainant has preferred the preset appeal on the grounds that the trial court\nhas not applied its mind properly while passing the impugned judgment and order. It has failed to\ntake note of the documents furnished by the appellant-complainant at the time of evidence which\nclearly indicates the deliberate intention of the respondent-accused in issuing the cheque and\ncommitting a crime as per Section 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, (for short 'the\nAct') beyond any reasonable doubt. The reasons adopted by the trial court for acquitting the\nrespondent-accused are erroneous. The trial court has ignored that the respondent-accused has\nutterly failed to rebut the presumption raised under Section 139 of the Act. The trial court has also\nneglected to consider several judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and of this Court while\npassing the judgment. The judgment is based on conjectures and surmises and it needs perusal of\nthe entire case records to set aside the judgment and to convict the respondent-accused. Hence, the\nappellant-complainant sought to allow the appeal.\n\n3. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant- complainant, during the course of the arguments,\nmade submission that issuance of the cheque and the signature on the cheque has been admitted by\nthe respondent-accused and hence, there is initial presumption as per Sections 118(a) and 139 of the\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181995120/                                                                2                              Mr B Shivaram vs Mr M V Venkatesh on 3 February, 2015\n\nAct in favour of the complainant and this aspect has been totally misconstrued by the trial court. It\nis also his submission that unless and until, the accused has rebutted the said presumption with\ncogent and satisfactory materials, the complainant is not suppose to explain the sources of income\nand his financial capacity to advance loan of Rs.3.00 lakh to the accused. Even then, the\ncomplainant, in his evidence before the trial court, has stated on oath that the amount reserved for\ncomplainant's daughter's marriage was given to the accused. It is also submission of the learned\nCounsel that merely, the ground that the complainant has failed to pay the installments to the bank\nto repay the loan amount borrowed from the bank itself is not sufficient to come to the conclusion\nthat he was not having financial capacity to advance loan of Rs.3.00 lakh to the respondent-accused.\nThe learned Counsel submitted that even though notice was served, the respondent-accused has not\nsent any reply to the said notice. The evidence on record were wrongly interpreted and wrongly\nappreciated by the trial court. Hence, submitted that the judgment and order under appeal is illegal.\nThe learned Counsel further submitted that there was no property dispute between the accused and\nthe complainant's side and otherwise, the accused could have filed a suit. The bank statement relied\nupon by the accused is helpful to the complainant himself. Hence, submitted to allow the appeal and\nset aside the judgment and order. In support of his contention, learned counsel for the appellant has\nrelied upon the following decisions filed along with memo dated 14.1.2015.\n\n1. 2007 Vol.5.S.C 264 (Kamal S Vs. Vidhyadharn M J)\n\n2. ILR 2008 KAR 643 (M/s Q-Soft System & Solutions (P) Limited Vs. H.N. Giridhar\n\n3. ILR 2006 KAR 4672 (J. Ramaraj Vs. Hiyaz Khan)\n\n4. JT 2002 Vol.6 S.C 119 (I.C.D.S. Ltd. Vs.

(Ghaziahad Development Authority Vs. Balbir Singh)\n\n10. 2002(3) KCCR 2008 (Smt. Bhavani Vs. D.C. Doddarangaiah and Another\n\n4. Per contra, it is the contention of learned counsel appearing for the respondent-accused that the\nevidence of P.W.2, during the course of cross examination, shows that her daughter's age was 18\nyears and when the alleged transaction took place, her daughter was aged 17 years. Hence, he\nsubmitted that, this itself improbablise the contention of the appellant-complainant that he was\nhaving Rs.3.00 lakh for the marriage of his daughter. The learned counsel also submitted the\nfinancial capacity of the appellant-complainant has been properly appreciated by the trial court and\n\n\n\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181995120/                                                                3                              Mr B Shivaram vs Mr M V Venkatesh on 3 February, 2015\n\nthere is material on record that the complainant himself is a defaulter in making the regular\npayment of installment to the bank wherein he borrowed the loan. Hence, he submitted that the\ntrial court has rightly appreciated the evidence, both oral and documentary, and rightly acquitted\nthe respondent accused. There is no illegality in the case. Hence, submitted to dismiss the appeal. In\nsupport of his contention learned counsel appearing for the respondent-accused has relied upon the\nfollowing decisions filed along with the memo dated 14.1.2015:\n\n         1. Crl.Apl. No.2402/2014 (SC) (K Subramani Vs. K Damodara Naidu)\n\n        2. 2014 AIR SCW 2158 (John K Abraham Vs. Simon C Abraham and another)\n\n        3. 2014 (3) Crimes 291 SC (Sanghian Pandian Rajkumar Vsl. Central Bureau of\n       Investigation and another with Balkrishan Rajendraprasad Chaubey Vs. Central\n      Bureau of Investigation and another.)\n\n        4. (2010) 11 SCC 441 (Rangappa Vs. Sri Mohan)\n\n        5. I have perused pleadings of the parties, oral evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2 and D.W.1\n      and also the documents produced in the case by both sides. I have also perused the\n       decisions relied upon by counsel on both sides which are referred above.\n\n        6. Let me refer to the relevant portion in the oral evidence of the witnesses. P.W.1 is\n       the appellant-\n\ncomplainant. In his affidavit, by way of examination of chief, P.W.1 has reiterated the averments\nmade in the complaint filed under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. before the Magistrate Court. In the\nevidence, he has stated that accused, who is his brother-in-law, had approached him for financial\nassistance of Rs.3.00 lakh during the 2nd week of October 2008 to meet his urgent needs and as\nsuc...",
