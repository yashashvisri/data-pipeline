the facts as well as law which prevails on the issue as to whether,
the candidates claiming eligibility on the basis of the qualification
of B.Ed. and 18 months diploma are to be treated eligible or not.
29. As per the 2018 Rules governing the service, the candidates
having B.Ed. qualification were only being considered eligible on
the ground that they were having qualifications as per the
guidelines of the NCTE. On the date when the Advertisement came
i.e. 06.03.2020, keeping in view the guidelines of the NCTE as
amended on 28.06.2018, the qualification of B.Ed. was a valid
qualification to be considered for appointment as ETT. It is on this
ground that it is contended by learned senior counsel for the
petitioners that once, on the day when the Advertisement was
issued, the claim of the petitioners was valid to be considered, they
cannot be made ineligible subsequently.

30. It is to be noticed that the amendment to the guidelines of the
NCTE qua the validity of the Notification dated 28.06.2018 came
up for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
Devesh Sharma's case (supra). The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
after considering the issue raised therein held that the amendment
of the NCTE guidelines vide amendment dated 28.06.2018 so as to
make candidates having B.Ed. Qualification, eligible, was not valid.
The claim of the similarly situated candidates, who were claiming
eligibility to participate in selection for the posts of ETT on the
basis of having B.Ed. qualification in pursuance to the
Advertisement issued by the Government of Rajasthan, was
declined. As per the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India, the candidates with B.Ed. qualification could not have been
made eligible by the NCTE by amending its guidelines vide
Notification dated 28.06.2018 and the said Notification dated
28.06.2018 was set-aside. The implication of the said judgment is
that the amendment dated 28.06.2018 cannot be treated as part of
NCTE guidelines and once, the amendment dated 28.06.2018 is not
valid, the candidates having B.Ed. qualification cannot claim
eligibility as the same had its basis the Notification dated
28.06.2018 of the NCTE which was struck down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court and, therefore, their claim to be treated as eligible
so as to compete for the post of ETT as advertised on 06.03.2020
cannot be accepted in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in Devesh Sharma's case (supra).

31. It has been conceded by learned senior counsel appearing on
behalf of the petitioners that from the date of the judgment in
Devesh Sharma's case (supra), the candidates having B.Ed.
qualifications cannot be allowed to be treated as eligible, however,
it is contended that as the selection process had already been
initiated in the present case through Advertisement dated
06.03.2020 which fact is much prior to the judgment passed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Devesh Sharma's case (supra) on

Supreme Court of India, the judgment in Devesh Sharma's case

fact, as a one time measure, the petitioners on the basis of B.Ed.
qualification have to be treated eligible and the said judgment
cannot be brought into operation by the respondents to declare the
petitioners as ineligible.
32. With regard to the said argument, it may be noticed that certain
observations have been made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India while passing judgment in Devesh Sharma's case (supra),
wherein, it is said to have prospective applicability but the said

same. Through Part-I Rules, 2009 pension of employees who retired
prior to 01.01.2006 was directed to be fixed in a manner envisaged
therein and the method of fixing pension of employees who were in
service as on 01.01.2006 and were to retire thereafter was dealt by

notified only on 17.04.2009.
2. Upon the Notification of the Part-I and Part-II Rules, 2009,
certain grievances were raised by the retired employees qua the
Part-I Rules, 2009 as well as by Part-II Rules, 2009.
3. The grievance raised by the petitioners, who had already retired
upto 31.12.2005 was that vide the provisions of Part-II Rules, 2009,
33 years which was envisaged for the grant of maximum pension

to them as the said Part-II Rules, 2009 have only been made
applicable to employees who retire post 31.12.2005, causing
prejudice to them and on account of the same, plea was raised
before this Court to grant the maximum pension on completion of
28 years of service even to the retired employees, who had retired
prior to 01.01.2006, while implementing Part-I Rules, 2009 as well

the scope of interpretation of Part-I Rules, 2009, however, the
computation formula for their pension calculation remained the

JUDGMENT DATED: 13/12/2024 undefined
Learned counsel, however, states that the first
respondent had lost out on the encashment of his
earned and medical leaves, due to the injuries
suffered by him, a fact that has already been
addressed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal
(MACT). First respondent was also denied and
deprived of certain allowances that were paid to
him when he was in the CID department, viz., the
intelligence allowance, special allowances and
special pay allowance, as he was transferred from
the CID Department to the Wireless Department on
account of his injuries. Further, the first respondent
underwent an operation and an implant has been
fixed on his spine which affects him physically. The
first respondent, owing to the operation and related
medical issues, has been deprived of postretirement
earning. Learned counsel has also drawn our
attention to the fact that as per the certificate of
disability, the said respondent has suffered 75%
disability in the lower limbs. However, during the
course of the hearing, the learned counsel has
accepted that the first respondent can move
around, but sometimes he requires assistance.
[4] In view of the accepted position that the first
respondent had continued to work, we do not think
the High Court was correct in awarding
compensation of Rs.56,44,378/- (Rupees Fifty Six
Lakhs Forty Four Thousand Three Hundred and
Seventy Eight only) by applying the multiplier to
the net salary payable to the first respondent. The
first respondent has continued to earn the monthly
salary he was earlier drawing, including
increments, except some allowances given due to
the nature of posting. The first respondent, at the
time of the injury, was 56 years old and had about
four years of service till his retirement. The High
Court also failed to notice that the injury certificate
did not relate to permanent disability in the entire
body, and had certified 75% disability in the lower
limbs. As noted above, the first respondent is not
immobilized. He can perform and undertake daily
chores without help and assistance.""

undefined Supreme Court of India, if we apply to the facts of the
present case, we do not find any error on the part of the Tribunal as
not awarding compensation under the head of future loss of income
to the claimant.
16. Of course, the judgment, which are so cited by learned advocate
for claimant would have laid down the law that merely because
income of injured claimant increased would not disentitle him from
not to receive future loss of income. The facts are not so similar to
the facts at hand. All these decisions are distinguishable, which we
would like to say so herein below.

chartered accountant and not a government servant like the
claimant working in the public sector bank. In the peculiar facts
and circumstances of that case, on the following observation, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had granted future loss of income

NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1741/2024 JUDGMENT DATED:
13/12/2024 undefined ""[14] In the last few years, law in this aspect
has been straightened by this Court by removing certain cobwebs
that had been created because of some divergent views on certain
aspects. It is not even necessary to refer to all these cases. We find
that the principle of determination of compensation in the case of
permanent/partial disablement has been exhaustively dealt with
after referring to the relevant case law on the subject in the case of
Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar & Ors, 2011 1 SCC 343 in the following
words:
""Assessment of future loss of earnings due to
permanent disability
8. Disability refers to any restriction or lack of
ability to perform an activity in the manner
considered normal for a human being. Permanent
disability refers to the residuary incapacity or loss
of use of some part of the body, found existing at
the end of the period of treatment and
recuperation, after achieving the maximum bodily
improvement or recovery which is likely to remain
for the remainder life of the injured. Temporary
disability refers to the incapacity or loss of use of
some part of the body on account of the injury,
which will cease to exist at the end of the period of
treatment and recuperation. Permanent disability
can be either partial or total. Partial permanent
disability refers to a person's inability to perform all
the duties and bodily functions that he could
perform before the accident, though he is able to
perform some of them and is still able to engage in
some gainful activity. Total permanent disability
refers to a person's inability to perform any
avocation or employment related activities as a
result of the accident. The permanent disabilities
that may arise from motor accident injuries, are of
a much wider range when compared to the physical
disabilities which are enumerated in the Persons
with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of
Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (""the
Disabilities Act"", for short). But if any of the
disabilities enumerated in Section 2(i) of the
Disabilities Act are the Page 20 of 38 Uploaded by

NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1741/2024
JUDGMENT DATED: 13/12/2024 undefined result
of injuries sustained in a motor accident, they can
be permanent disabilities for the purpose of
claiming compensation.
9. The percentage of permanent disability is
expressed by the doctors with reference to the
whole body, or more often than not, with reference
to a particular limb. When a disability certificate
states that the injured has suffered permanent
disability to an extent of 45% of the left lower
limb, it is not the same as 45% permanent
disability with reference to the whole body. The
extent of disability of a limb (or part of the body)
expressed in terms of a percentage of the total
functions of that limb, obviously cannot be
assumed to be the extent of disability of the whole
body. If there is 60% permanent disability of the
right hand and 80% permanent disability of left
leg, it does not mean that the extent of permanent
disability with reference to the whole body is 140%
(that is 80% plus 60%). If different parts of the
body have suffered different percentages of
disabilities, the sum total thereof expressed in
terms of the permanent disability with reference to
the whole body cannot obviously exceed 100%.
10. Where the claimant suffers a permanent
disability as a result of injuries, the assessment of
compensation under the head of loss of future
earnings would depend upon the effect and impact
of such permanent disability on his earning
capacity. The Tribunal should not mechanically
apply the percentage of permanent disability as the
percentage of economic loss or loss of earning
capacity. In most of the cases, the percentage of
economic loss, that is, the percentage of loss of
earning capacity, arising from a permanent
disability will be different from the percentage of
permanent disability. Some Tribunals wrongly
assume that in all cases, a particular extent
(percentage) of permanent disability would result
in a corresponding loss of earning Page 21 of 38

JUDGMENT DATED: 13/12/2024 undefined
capacity, and consequently, if the evidence
produced show 45% as the permanent disability,
will hold that there is 45% loss of future earning
capacity. In most of the cases, equating the extent
(percentage) of loss of earning capacity to the
extent (percentage) of permanent disability will
result in award of either too low or too high a
compensation.
11. What requires to be assessed by the Tribunal is
the effect of the permanent disability on the
earning capacity of the injured; and after assessing
the loss of earning capacity in terms of a
percentage of the income, it has to be quantified in
terms of money, to arrive at the future loss of
earnings (by applying the standard multiplier
method used to determine loss of dependency). We
may however note that in some cases, on
appreciation of evidence and assessment, the
Tribunalmay find that the percentage of loss of
earning capacity as a result of the permanent
disability, is approximately the same as the
percentage of permanent disability in which case,
of course, the Tribunalwill adopt the said
percentage for determination of compensation.""
[15] The crucial factor which has to be taken into consideration,
thus, is to assess as to whether the permanent disability has any
adverse effect on the earning capacity of the injured. In this sense,
the MACT approached the issue in right direction by taking into
consideration the aforesaid test. However, we feel that the",,"order as to

has been reduced to 28 years, the benefit of the same was not given
to them as the said Part-II Rules, 2009 have only been made
applicable to employees who retire post 31.12.2005, causing
prejudice to them and on account of the same, plea was raised
before this Court to grant the maximum pension on completion of
28 years of service even to the retired employees, who had retired
prior to 01.01.2006, while implementing Part-I Rules, 2009 as well
as Part-II Rules, 2009.
4. Said grievance of the employees who retired prior to 01.01.2006
qua fixation of cut off date as 01.01.2006 as envisaged under Part-II
Rules, 2009, due to which benefit of Rule 8(1) of Part-II Rules,
2009 was not being extended to them, came up for consideration
before a Division Bench of this Court in a Bunch of Petitions, which
issue was decided by the Division Bench on 21.12.2012 through the
case titled as R.K. Aggarwal and others Vs. State of Haryana and
others, 2013(4) SCT 286. The Division Bench, after noticing the
grievance of the employees who retired prior to 01.01.2006, who
were petitioners therein, decided to uphold the cut off date of
01.01.2006 prescribed by Part-II Rules, 2009 holding that both the
set of employees i.e. those who retired prior to 01.01.2006 and
those who were in service on the said date on 25 of 69 :::

formed a separate class. The only benefit given to them was within
the scope of interpretation of Part-I Rules, 2009, however, the
computation formula for their pension calculation remained the
same as applicable to them at the time of their retirement. It may
be noticed that certain Notifications which were issued by the State
of Haryana on the lines of Government of India with regard to the
fixation of pension of the retired employees, who had retired prior
to 01.01.2006, which were causing prejudice to them even qua
implementation of Part-I Rules, 2009, were though set-aside by the
Division Bench and a direction was given to fix the pension of the
retired employees, who had retired prior to 01.01.2006 in the
particular manner as envisaged by the substantive provisions of
Part-I Rules, 2009.
5. The judgment in R.K. Aggarwal and others (supra) upholding the
cut off date of 01.01.2006 prescribed by Part-II Rules, 2009,
whereby a classification has been made between the employees who
retire prior and post 01.01.2006 has already been upheld by the

the facts as well as law which prevails on the issue as to whether,
the candidates claiming eligibility on the basis of the qualification
of B.Ed. and 18 months diploma are to be treated eligible or not.
29. As per the 2018 Rules governing the service, the candidates
having B.Ed. qualification were only being considered eligible on
the ground that they were having qualifications as per the
guidelines of the NCTE. On the date when the Advertisement came
i.e. 06.03.2020, keeping in view the guidelines of the NCTE as
amended on 28.06.2018, the qualification of B.Ed. was a valid
qualification to be considered for appointment as ETT. It is on this
ground that it is contended by learned senior counsel for the
petitioners that once, on the day when the Advertisement was
issued, the claim of the petitioners was valid to be considered, they
cannot be made ineligible subsequently.

30. It is to be noticed that the amendment to the guidelines of the
NCTE qua the validity of the Notification dated 28.06.2018 came
up for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
Devesh Sharma's case (supra). The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
after considering the issue raised therein held that the amendment
of the NCTE guidelines vide amendment dated 28.06.2018 so as to
make candidates having B.Ed. Qualification, eligible, was not valid.
The claim of the similarly situated candidates, who were claiming
eligibility to participate in selection for the posts of ETT on the
basis of having B.Ed. qualification in pursuance to the
Advertisement issued by the Government of Rajasthan, was
declined. As per the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India, the candidates with B.Ed. qualification could not have been
made eligible by the NCTE by amending its guidelines vide
Notification dated 28.06.2018 and the said Notification dated
28.06.2018 was set-aside. The implication of the said judgment is
that the amendment dated 28.06.2018 cannot be treated as part of
NCTE guidelines and once, the amendment dated 28.06.2018 is not
valid, the candidates having B.Ed. qualification cannot claim
eligibility as the same had its basis the Notification dated
28.06.2018 of the NCTE which was struck down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court and, therefore, their claim to be treated as eligible
so as to compete for the post of ETT as advertised on 06.03.2020
cannot be accepted in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in Devesh Sharma's case (supra).

31. It has been conceded by learned senior counsel appearing on
behalf of the petitioners that from the date of the judgment in
Devesh Sharma's case (supra), the candidates having B.Ed.
qualifications cannot be allowed to be treated as eligible, however,
it is contended that as the selection process had already been
initiated in the present case through Advertisement dated
06.03.2020 which fact is much prior to the judgment passed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Devesh Sharma's case (supra) on
11.08.2023 and keeping in view the observations of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India, the judgment in Devesh Sharma's case
(supra), said judgment is prospective, hence in the light of the said
fact, as a one time measure, the petitioners on the basis of B.Ed.
qualification have to be treated eligible and the said judgment
cannot be brought into operation by the respondents to declare the
petitioners as ineligible.
32. With regard to the said argument, it may be noticed that certain
observations have been made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India while passing judgment in Devesh Sharma's case (supra),
wherein, it is said to have prospective applicability but the said
observations have to be read in view of certain facts and subsequent
clarifications given by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.

W.P.A. no.
9979 of 2022",Not Found,Not Found,,,"conclusion of
trial in near future is bleak. The delay in trial is not wholly
attributable to the petitioner.
34. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has time and again held that
prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty of an
offence should not be permitted to become punishment without
trial and in such a case Article 21 applies irrespective of the
seriousness of the crime. The right to life and personal liberty
enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution is overarching and
sacrosanct. A constitutional Court cannot be restrained from
granting bail to an accused on account of restrictive statutory
provisions in a penal statute if it finds that the 16 right of the
accused/under-trial under Article 21 of the Constitution has been
infringed. Even in the case of interpretation of a penal statute,
howsoever stringent it may be, a constitutional Court has to lean in
favour of constitutionalism and the rule of law of which liberty is
an intrinsic part.
35. Since the case primarily depends on documentary evidence
which is in custody of the E.D, there is no scope for the petitioner to
tamper with the same. With regard to the apprehension that the
petitioner shall influence witnesses or may abscond if released on
bail, stringent conditions may be imposed upon him to address the
concern.
36. Though the E.D. has stated that out of the entire period of
detention of the petitioner, he was in judicial custody only for 266
days and remained in the hospital for the rest of the period, the
hospitalisation of the petitioner during his incarceration is also
deemed to be judicial custody.
37. Upon consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case,
submission made on behalf of the parties as well as material on
record, this Court is inclined to release the petitioner on bail subject
to stringent conditions keeping in mind his right to speedy trial
under section 21 of the Constitution as well as his prolonged
incarceration without trial.
38. Accordingly, the application for bail being C.R.M. (S.B) 227 of
2023 is allowed.

40. The petitioner be released on bail upon furnishing bond of Rs.

i. The petitioner shall surrender his passport with
the learned trial Court at once.
ii. He shall not leave the territorial jurisdiction of
the learned trial Court without leave of the trial
Court. iii. He shall appear before the learned trial
Court on every date of hearing fixed before the
learned Court. iv. He shall not tamper with
evidence or intimidate witnesses in any manner
whatsoever.
v. He shall not indulge in any criminal activity and
shall not communicate with or come in contact
with the witnesses. vi. He shall provide his mobile
number before the learned trial Court and shall not
change the said number without prior intimation to
the Court.
41. In the event the petitioner violates any of the bail conditions as
stated above, the learned trial Court shall be at liberty to cancel his
bail in accordance with law without further reference to this Court.
42. It is made clear that the observation made in this judgment is
for the limited purpose of deciding the bail application and shall
not be construed as an expression of opinion on the merits of the
case. The learned trial Court shall deal with the matter
independently in accordance with law without being influenced by
any observation which may have been made in this judgment.

A perusal of Clause 9 (b) of the DNIET shows that
the letter of intent or the agreement would be
liable to be terminated in terms of the provisions of
Clause 9 (a) of the DNIET and in such an event, the
EMD and performance security would be liable to
be forfeited and the agency would be liable to be
debarred from AAI tenders for a period of
minimum of three years. Clause 10 of the DNIET
which deals with conflict of interest lays down that
a bidder shall not have a conflict of interest that
affects the bidding process and that any bidder
found to have a conflict of interest would be
disqualified. The 18 of 44 ::: Downloaded on -

(O&M) 19 clause then goes on to explain as to
when a bidder would be deemed to have a conflict
of interest.
33. Clause 29 of the Terms & Conditions in
Appendix 1 of the licence deals with Dispute
Resolution;
""(29) All disputes and differences arising out of or
in any way touching or concerning this Agreement
(except these the decision whereof is otherwise
herein before expressly provided for or to which
the AAI ACT, 1994 and the rules framed there-
under which are now enforce or which may here-
after come into force are applicable), shall, in the
first instance, be referred to a Dispute Resolution
Committee (DRC) setup at the airports, for which a
written application should be obtained from the
party and the points clearly spelt out. In case the
dispute is not resolved within 45 days of reference,
then the case shall be referred to the sole
arbitration of a person to be appointed by the
Chairman / Member/ RED of the Authority. The
award of the arbitrator so appointed shall be final
and binding on the parties. The Arbitration &
Conciliation Act 1996 as amended up to date shall
be applicable. Once the arbitration clause has been
invoked, the DRC process will cease to be
operative. It will be no bar that the Arbitrator
appointed as aforesaid is or has been an employee
of the Authority and the appointment of the
Arbitrator will not be challenged or be open to
question in any Court of Law, on this account.
Before making a reference to Dispute Resolution Committee, the
licensee will have to first deposit 50% of the disputed amount in the
form of BG (additional Bank Guarantee with validity of minimum
two (2) years from the date of making reference to DRC, and further
extendable) /DD/PO/NEFT with AAI and the consent shall be given

34. Coming to the communication dated 30.11.2022 (Annexure P-
4) only a reply dated 05.12.2022 (Annexure P-5) was submitted on
account of the receipt of complaints against the petitioner and
clarification was sought on five issues. After the award of the
licence, show cause notice dated 05.06.2023 (Annexure P-10) was
issued wherein the petitioner was called upon to explain as to why
action should not be taken against it on the grounds of conflict of
interest and material representation. It would be relevant to
mention here that the action referred to in Clause 9 (b) of the
DNIET was of termination of the licence and debarment. It is,
therefore, difficult to accept that there was no show cause notice as
regards debarment. Be that as it may,","order passed by the
Collector reflects that it is based on the counter-
affidavit filed by the Janpad Panchayat whereby it
is established that the appellants were related to
the members of the selection committee.
Subsequently, the collector held the process to be
vitiated by bias by applying the test of reasonable
likelihood of bias. Once again, upon challenge
being made by the appellants before the revisional
authority, their relationship with the members of
the selection committee was not disputed yet
violation of doctrine of audi altrem partem was
alleged merely due to non-joinder. After hearing
them, the plea of non- impleadment did not find
force before the revisional authority and the
challenge did not succeed. Aggrieved appellants
moved a writ petition before the High Court where
ample opportunity was given by learned Single
Judge and they were allowed to inspect the
records. Thus, an opportunity to controvert the
findings of the Collector and the Commissioner and
factual narration thereof was duly

Citation No:=2024:PHHC:171044-DB CWP-11390-2024 (O&M) 44
afforded. After sufficient opportunities given by the Ld. Single
Judge, the appellants neither denied their relationship with the
members of the selection committee nor demonstrated that how the
findings are perverse or contrary to record, causing any prejudice to
them.
45. In the sequel of above factual narration, first limb of natural
justice that is 'rule against bias' was proved as reasonable likelihood
of bias was fully established irrefutably. The violation of another
limb i.e. audi alteram partem, which is procedural, has been prayed
by the appellants on the pretext of their non-joinder at the initial
stage; in my opinion, without showing prejudice mere non- joinder
even at initial stage does not violate the natural justice doctrine in
the case at hand.""
55. A similar view was taken by a constitution Bench of the
Supreme Court on India in the case of Jayantilal Ratanchand Shah
vs. Reserve Bank of India and Others (supra) and the High Court of
Delhi in the case of Aneuser Busch Inbev India Limited versus
Commissioner (Excise), Entertainment and Luxury Tax) and others.
As an upshot of the aforesaid discussion, we find the writ petition to
be devoid of merit and accordingly the same is dismissed.
Pending application(s), if any, stand(s) disposed of accordingly.

29. As per the 2018 Rules governing the service, the candidates
having B.Ed. qualification were only being considered eligible on
the ground that they were having qualifications as per the
guidelines of the NCTE. On the date when the Advertisement came
i.e. 06.03.2020, keeping in view the guidelines of the NCTE as
amended on 28.06.2018, the qualification of B.Ed. was a valid
qualification to be considered for appointment as ETT. It is on this
ground that it is contended by learned senior counsel for the
petitioners that once, on the day when the Advertisement was
issued, the claim of the petitioners was valid to be considered, they
cannot be made ineligible subsequently.

NCTE qua the validity of the Notification dated 28.06.2018 came
up for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
Devesh Sharma's case (supra). The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
after considering the issue raised therein held that the amendment
of the NCTE guidelines vide amendment dated 28.06.2018 so as to
make candidates having B.Ed. Qualification, eligible, was not valid.
The claim of the similarly situated candidates, who were claiming
eligibility to participate in selection for the posts of ETT on the
basis of having B.Ed. qualification in pursuance to the
Advertisement issued by the Government of Rajasthan, was
declined. As per the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India, the candidates with B.Ed. qualification could not have been
made eligible by the NCTE by amending its guidelines vide
Notification dated 28.06.2018 and the said Notification dated
28.06.2018 was set-aside. The implication of the said judgment is
that the amendment dated 28.06.2018 cannot be treated as part of
NCTE guidelines and once, the amendment dated 28.06.2018 is not
valid, the candidates having B.Ed. qualification cannot claim
eligibility as the same had its basis the Notification dated
28.06.2018 of the NCTE which was struck down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court and, therefore, their claim to be treated as eligible
so as to compete for the post of ETT as advertised on 06.03.2020
cannot be accepted in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in Devesh Sharma's case (supra).

31. It has been conceded by learned senior counsel appearing on
behalf of the petitioners that from the date of the judgment in
Devesh Sharma's case (supra), the candidates having B.Ed.
qualifications cannot be allowed to be treated as eligible, however,
it is contended that as the selection process had already been
initiated in the present case through Advertisement dated
06.03.2020 which fact is much prior to the judgment passed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Devesh Sharma's case (supra) on
11.08.2023 and keeping in view the observations of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India, the judgment in Devesh Sharma's case
(supra), said judgment is prospective, hence in the light of the said
fact, as a one time measure, the petitioners on the basis of B.Ed.
qualification have to be treated eligible and the said judgment
cannot be brought into operation by the respondents to declare the
petitioners as ineligible.
32. With regard to the said argument, it may be noticed that certain
observations have been made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India while passing judgment in Devesh Sharma's case (supra),

1. The Government of Haryana vide two separate Notifications
dated 17.04.2009 decided to implement the recommendations of
the 6th Pay Commission. Two separate Rules were notified i.e.
Haryana Civil Services (Revised Pension) Part-I Rules 2009 (here-in-
after referred to as 'Part-I Rules, 2009') and Haryana Civil Services
(Revised Pension) Part-II Rules, 2009 (here- in-after referred to as
'Part-II Rules, 2009) respectively for the implementation of the
same. Through Part-I Rules, 2009 pension of employees who retired
prior to 01.01.2006 was directed to be fixed in a manner envisaged
therein and the method of fixing pension of employees who were in
service as on 01.01.2006 and were to retire thereafter was dealt by
Part-II Rules 2009. The 24 of 69 ::: Downloaded on - 24-07-2024

2009 as well as Part-II Rules, 2009 were made operational with
retrospective effect i.e. from 01.01.2006 although the same were
notified only on 17.04.2009.
2. Upon the Notification of the Part-I and Part-II Rules, 2009,
certain grievances were raised by the retired employees qua the
Part-I Rules, 2009 as well as by Part-II Rules, 2009.
3. The grievance raised by the petitioners, who had already retired
upto 31.12.2005 was that vide the provisions of Part-II Rules, 2009,
33 years which was envisaged for the grant of maximum pension
has been reduced to 28 years, the benefit of the same was not given
to them as the said Part-II Rules, 2009 have only been made
applicable to employees who retire post 31.12.2005, causing
prejudice to them and on account of the same, plea was raised
before this Court to grant the maximum pension on completion of
28 years of service even to the retired employees, who had retired
prior to 01.01.2006, while implementing Part-I Rules, 2009 as well
as Part-II Rules, 2009.
4. Said grievance of the employees who retired prior to 01.01.2006
qua fixation of cut off date as 01.01.2006 as envisaged under Part-II
Rules, 2009, due to which benefit of Rule 8(1) of Part-II Rules,
2009 was not being extended to them, came up for consideration
before a Division Bench of this Court in a Bunch of Petitions, which
issue was decided by the Division Bench on 21.12.2012 through the
case titled as R.K. Aggarwal and others Vs. State of Haryana and
others, 2013(4) SCT 286. The Division Bench, after noticing the
grievance of the employees who retired prior to 01.01.2006, who
were petitioners therein, decided to uphold the cut off date of
01.01.2006 prescribed by Part-II Rules, 2009 holding that both the
set of employees i.e. those who retired prior to 01.01.2006 and
those who were in service on the said date on 25 of 69 :::

formed a separate class. The only benefit given to them was within
the scope of interpretation of Part-I Rules, 2009, however, the
computation formula for their pension calculation remained the
same as applicable to them at the time of their retirement. It may
be noticed that certain Notifications which were issued by the State
of Haryana on the lines of Government of India with regard to the
fixation of pension of the retired employees, who had retired prior
to 01.01.2006, which were causing prejudice to them even qua
implementation of Part-I Rules, 2009, were though set-aside by the
Division Bench and a direction was given to fix the pension of the
retired employees, who had retired prior to 01.01.2006 in the
particular manner as envisaged by the substantive provisions of
Part-I Rules, 2009.
5. The judgment in R.K. Aggarwal and others (supra) upholding the
cut off date of 01.01.2006 prescribed by Part-II Rules, 2009,
whereby a classification has been made between the employees who
retire prior and post 01.01.2006 has already been upheld by the

the facts as well as law which prevails on the issue as to whether,
the candidates claiming eligibility on the basis of the qualification
of B.Ed. and 18 months diploma are to be treated eligible or not.
29. As per the 2018 Rules governing the service, the candidates
having B.Ed. qualification were only being considered eligible on
the ground that they were having qualifications as per the
guidelines of the NCTE. On the date when the Advertisement came
i.e. 06.03.2020, keeping in view the guidelines of the NCTE as
amended on 28.06.2018, the qualification of B.Ed. was a valid
qualification to be considered for appointment as ETT. It is on this
ground that it is contended by learned senior counsel for the
petitioners that once, on the day when the Advertisement was
issued, the claim of the petitioners was valid to be considered, they
cannot be made ineligible subsequently.

29. As per the 2018 Rules governing the service, the candidates
having B.Ed. qualification were only being considered eligible on
the ground that they were having qualifications as per the
guidelines of the NCTE. On the date when the Advertisement came
i.e. 06.03.2020, keeping in view the guidelines of the NCTE as
amended on 28.06.2018, the qualification of B.Ed. was a valid
qualification to be considered for appointment as ETT. It is on this
ground that it is contended by learned senior counsel for the
petitioners that once, on the day when the Advertisement was
issued, the claim of the petitioners was valid to be considered, they
cannot be made ineligible subsequently.

30. It is to be noticed that the amendment to the guidelines of the
NCTE qua the validity of the Notification dated 28.06.2018 came
up for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
Devesh Sharma's case (supra). The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
after considering the issue raised therein held that the amendment
of the NCTE guidelines vide amendment dated 28.06.2018 so as to
make candidates having B.Ed. Qualification, eligible, was not valid.
The claim of the similarly situated candidates, who were claiming
eligibility to participate in selection for the posts of ETT on the
basis of having B.Ed. qualification in pursuance to the
Advertisement issued by the Government of Rajasthan, was
declined. As per the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India, the candidates with B.Ed. qualification could not have been
made eligible by the NCTE by amending its guidelines vide
Notification dated 28.06.2018 and the said Notification dated
28.06.2018 was set-aside. The implication of the said judgment is
that the amendment dated 28.06.2018 cannot be treated as part of
NCTE guidelines and once, the amendment dated 28.06.2018 is not
valid, the candidates having B.Ed. qualification cannot claim
eligibility as the same had its basis the Notification dated
28.06.2018 of the NCTE which was struck down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court and, therefore, their claim to be treated as eligible
so as to compete for the post of ETT as advertised on 06.03.2020
cannot be accepted in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in Devesh Sharma's case (supra).

behalf of the petitioners that from the date of the judgment in

qualifications cannot be allowed to be treated as eligible, however,
it is contended that as the selection process had already been

06.03.2020 which fact is much prior to the judgment passed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Devesh Sharma's case (supra) on
11.08.2023 and keeping in view the observations of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India, the judgment in Devesh Sharma's case
(supra), said judgment is prospective, hence in the light of the said
fact, as a one time measure, the petitioners on the basis of B.Ed.
qualification have to be treated eligible and the said judgment
cannot be brought into operation by the respondents to declare the
petitioners as ineligible.
32. With regard to the said argument, it may be noticed that certain
observations have been made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India while passing judgment in Devesh Sharma's case (supra),
wherein, it is said to have prospective applicability but the said
observations have to be read in view of certain facts and subsequent
