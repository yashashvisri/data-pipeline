No. 13 of 1997(R) \n \n \nOne injury was antemortem in nature produced by flame. \nCause of death opined to be shock as a result of extensive burn \ninjury.  \nTime elapsed since death till P.M. examination about 18 \nhours to 24 hours. The body was identified by SI RN Singh and \nMd. Taiyab and Md. Kurban.  \nThe injuries caused to the deceased was sufficient in \nordinary course of nature to cause her death. \nIn his cross-examination, this witness has stated that the \nentry is made in the hospital register for indoor patient. \n19. \nIt is admitted position that the occurrence took place on \n19.01.1994 at about 9 AM and the deceased under extensive burnt \ninjuries was brought to the hospital by her mother namely Nuresh \nKhatoon, (P.W.-2) and she was treated as indoor patient and succumbed \nto death due to injuries at evening at about 6 PM, therefore the first \ncondition is established beyond doubt.  \n(ii) \nSo far Second condition is concerned, it is also admitted fact that \nthe deceased was married with the appellant on 06.05.1990 and she died \non 19.01.1994 i.e. within seven years of her marriage.  \n(iii)  Third and fourth conditions i.e. soon before her death the woman \nmust have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any \nrelatives of her husband and such cruelty or harassment must be for, or \nin connection with, demand for dowry. \n \nIn this connection, the oral testimony of witnesses, particularly \nmother, father, sister and brother of the deceased have consistently \ntestified supporting the demand of arrear of dowry agreed at the time of \nmarriage to be paid later on.  \n \nP.W.3 namely Wazir Mian, father of the deceased-cum-\ninformant who has deposed in clear terms that at the time of marriage he \nhad given dowry according to his capacity, but some articles were left to \nbe given to the accused persons, therefore, after few days of her \nmarriage, the accused persons started demanding to bring those articles \n \n \n2025:JHHC:23765-DB \n \n \n \n \n12 \n                       Cr. Appeal (D.B.) No. 13 of 1997(R) \n \n \nand cash from the deceased and compelled her to be fulfilled by her \nparents. He has further deposed that due to non-fulfillment of their \ndemand, the accused persons always subjected the deceased to various \natrocities. He has also deposed that since the marriage of the deceased \nwas performed in the same village, therefore, deceased always used to \nmeet with her mother and other family members and use to complain \nabout the demand and consequent physical and mental tortures meted to \nher. This witness also went to the house of the accused persons to assure \nthem that he will try to fulfill their demands but could not fulfill the \nsame due to paucity of fund. Thereafter, on 19.01.1994 at about 09:00 \nam in the morning he heard Halla coming from the matrimonial house of \nhis deceased daughter, he rushed towards the place of occurrence along \nwith his wife, P.W.-2, Nuresha Khatoon and P.W.-1 Munni Khatoon \nanother daughter and found his daughter was completely burnt but told \nthem that her husband and in-laws have sprinkled kerosine oil on her and \nlit the fire. Thereafter his wife (P.W.-2) Nuresha Khatoon brought the \ndeceased to hospital on Rikshaw.  \n \nP.W.-2, Nuresha Khatoon is the mother of the deceased. \nAccording to her evidence, Rs. 5000/- cash, one Television and one \nCycle were left to be given to accused persons as was agreed at the time \nof marriage. The accused persons were raising consistent demand of \naforesaid articles from the deceased and compelled her to bring from her \nparents. She has also stated that due to their poor financial condition, \naforesaid demands could not be fulfilled and the accused persons started \nsubjecting the deceased to harassment and cruelty both mental and \nphysical and she used to complain about the atrocities met with her to \nher mother while going to fetch water from the handpump. On the \nprevious night of occurrence also, the deceased complained about ill \ntreatment and torture meted to her and her apprehension that she might \nnot be spared due to non-fulfillment of the demand of dowry.  \n20. \nThe above versions regarding conditions No. (iii) and (iv) finds \nfurther corroboration from the evidence of P.W.-1, Munni Kumari, sister \n \n \n2025:JHHC:23765-DB \n \n \n \n \n13 \n                       Cr. Appeal (D.B.) No. 13 of 1997(R) \n \n \nof the deceased and P.W.5, Sattar Mian, brother of the deceased. It is also \nproved that it was consistent and persistent demand of money and other \narticles like TV and Cycle at the hands of appellant and his relatives and \ndue to non-fulfillment of which the deceased was subjected to cruelty \nand torture, soon before her death. \n21. \nThe defence has not been able to elicit any substantive materials \nfrom the witnesses of facts examined by the prosecution to rebut their \ntestimony as regards demand of cash and other articles and due to non-\nfulfillment of the same subjecting the deceased to ill treatment, torture \nand harassment rather by way of suggestion there is general denial from \nany demand and torture meted to deceased and they have been falsely \nimplicated due to ulterior motive of the witnesses to harass the accused \npersons.  \n22. \nThe defence has also attempted to rebut the prosecution story by \nadducing oral and documentary evidence.  \n \nD.W.-1 Ramchandra Hembrom, A.S.I. who was posted at \nGiridih Town, Police Station on the relevant date and time. According to \nhis evidence, on 19.01.1994, he had gone to Sadar Hospital, Giridih after \nreceiving information that a woman in a burnt condition has been \nadmitted there. He recorded the statement of injured Abida Khatoon at \nabout 1:30 PM which was basis of UD Case No. 01 of 1994 which was \ninvestigated by A.S.I.  Soudagar Yadav. According to this witness, the \ninjured woman told that while she was cooking food, her Saree caught \nfire and she raised alarm and the neighboring people assembled over \nthere who tried to save her. The statement of the victim was read over to \nher and she put her thumb impression finding the same to be correct.  \n23. \nIt is pertinent here to mention that the said statement as alleged to \nbe recorded by this witness of the deceased containing her thumb \nimpression has not been brought on record rather summary of the said \nstatement was recorded in para 3 of the case-diary, which has been \nmarked as Exhibit A in this case.  \nAdmittedly, no certificate was obtained from the concerned \n \n \n2025:JHHC:23765-DB \n \n \n \n \n14 \n                       Cr. Appeal (D.B.) No. 13 of 1997(R) \n \n \nDoctor, who was treating the deceased about her mental and physical \ncondition nor the statement was recorded in presence of any witness \nincluding the Doctor nor the record of the statement has been adduced in \nevidence, therefore no reliance can be placed on the evidence of D.W.-1. \nD.W.-2, Madina Khatoon, is a neighbor of accused Taiyab Mian, \nwho has simply expressed her no knowledge about any demand of \ndowry from the deceased at the hands of her husband and in-laws but a \nglaring fact supporting the prosecution story has been stated by her that \nwhen she went at the place of occurrence at the house of Taiyab Mian \nafter hearing Halla from his house, Abida Khatoon (deceased) was badly \nburnt and she was naked. She also admitted the presence of mother of \nthe deceased who rushed towards hospital along with injured Abida \nKhatoon. \nBeing a close-door neighbor of accused persons, she might not \nhave chosen to inculpate them. Moreover, the demand of money or any \nform of dowry pertains in between husband and in-laws of groom and \nfamily members of wife, which often takes place within four walls of \nhouse and for the sake of their prestige and honor in the society, no party \nwould like to make them public. Therefore, mere ignorance of D.W.-2 \nabout such demand is not sufficient to turn down prosecution story. \nD.W.-3, Vijay Mian is a Rikshaw Puller who has brought the \ndeceased in burnt condition to the hospital, but he has overheard the \nconversation between injured Abida Khatoon with her mother and \nreproduced the same as the injured was saying to her mother that she has \naccidently caught fire on her Sharee while cooking food, which is \ncontrary to the evidence of mother of the deceased.  \nD.W.-4, Mumtaz Ali is the owner of the garage. According to \nhim, on 19.01.1994 at about 8:30am, Taiyab Mian came to his garage to \ndischarge his duties, but at about 09:30 AM one person came and told \nhim that his wife got burnt, then he immediately rushed towards hospital.  \nThis witness was never interrogated by the police during \ninvestigation nor the accused at any point of time during investigation or \n \n \n2025:JHHC:23765-DB \n \n \n \n \n15 \n                       Cr. Appeal (D.B.) No. 13 of 1997(R) \n \n \neven at the time of cross examination of the prosecution witnesses has \never taken such plea that he had gone to the garage for discharging his \nduties early in the morning. There is no such time gap between \nhappening of the occurrence and presence of the accused at garage as \nalleged. It is also possible to reach the garage after commission of the \nalleged occurrence. Even in his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. the \naccused has not taken such plea, therefore, above testimony of witness \nholds no much water to disturb the prosecution story or otherwise cast \nany doubt over the prosecution case.  \n24. \nThe appellant had laid much emphasis that the death of the \ndeceased was natural one as per evidence of D.W.-1 who stated that the \nvictim herself stated before him in the hospital that while cooking food \nshe caught fire on her Saree and sustained burnt injuries.  \n25. \nThe next point is that the UD case was investigated and matter \nwas dropped by the police but the father of the deceased with oblique \nmotive lodged the complaint case and consequently FIR was lodged after \ntwo months of the occurrence without stating any explanation. \n26. \nThe above contentions could not be given any legal sanctity for \nfollowing reasons:- (i) firstly; it is admitted case of the prosecution and \nalso evident from the face of record that the deceased had got extreme \nburnt injuries and admitted to hospital on the same day of occurrence at \nabout 10am and admitted as an indoor patient. It is also evident that she \nsuccumbed to injury at about 6 pm. The doctor who conducted the \nautopsy on the dead body of deceased has spelt about the extensive burnt \ninjuries covering face, neck, tongue both sides, upper extremity and both \nthighs half including perineum was found. Singing of hair, eye lashes, \neye brows and blackening of skin were present. Redness was found. \nThere is no iota of evidence at all that at the time of admission, the \ndeceased was able to speak anything or was under conscious state and \nable to give any statement.
